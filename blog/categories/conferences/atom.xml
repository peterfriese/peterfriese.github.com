    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code Generation 2011 is <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/index.php">just around the corner</a> and if you haven't booked yet, <a href="http://evbk.software-acumen.com/makebooking.php?event=CG2011">you should hurry up</a> - a few places are still available!</p>

<p>Quite a number of my colleagues at itemis have been busy preparing for this conference in the past few weeks. Besides working hard to hit the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Indigo/Simultaneous_Release_Plan">Eclipse Release Train milestone for Indigo on June 22nd</a>, the Xtext team brushed up their hands-on sessions "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=17">Xtext Take I: Creating Code Generators with Xtend2</a>" and "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=16">Xtext Take II: Crafting Domain Specific Languages with Xtext and Xbase</a>". If you've been using Xtext, you're well aware of the power you have at your disposal with this tool. Xbase and Xtend2, however, take this experience to a whole new level. So make sure to mark your calendar for these two sessions!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But not only the Xtext team will share their expertise at CG2011 - Markus and Karsten will be also be in town to give hands-on tutorials and report from their experience:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=22">Type Systems for DSLs (Markus Völter)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=8">Graphiti + Xtext: mixing graphical and textual DSLs for sprayers/designers (Karsten Thoms / Bernhard Merkle)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=5">Introduction to JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS) (Markus Völter)</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The finale of the conference will be a panel discussion hosted by Markus on the topic of "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=20">Models, DSLs, Transformations: The Next 5 years</a>" - this should be a very interesting and lively discussion!</p>

<p><a href="http://lanyrd.com/people/hbehrens/">Heiko</a> <a href="http://lanyrd.com/people/peterfriese/">and I</a> will present "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=28">Cross-Platform Mobile Development with DSLs</a>" - a <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/cg2011/sdpgm/">fast-paced and fun mixture of slides, live coding (or modeling, if you will), videos and audience interaction</a>. Yes, that's right - the audience will be part of the show. Make sure to bring your web-enabled mobile phone and get the chance to win a price!</p>

<p>To keep track of the conference program(me), we at <a href="http://mobile.itemis.com">itemis mobile</a> have been busy to create a conference planner for your iOS and Android powered mobile phones. Here are the download links:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the huge success of the mobile apps for Eclipse Summit Europe, we decided to provide mobile apps for EclipseCon 2011, too. So instead of using a printed copy of the conference program, you can browse the schedule on your smart phone - wherever you are!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This year, we're providing a rather impressive lineup of mobile apps for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad (thanks to <a href="http://www.compeople.eu/blog/?p=786">Christian Campo who created a stand-alone iPad app</a>), BlackBerry (<a href="http://ekkes-apps.org/">Ekke is working on a updated version, AFAIK</a>), and all other smart phones that feature a browser.</p>

<p>All apps allow you to browse the program, select your favorite talks and get to know the speakers (with headshots so you recognise them in the hallways). We also have included maps of the convention center as well as Santa Clara.</p>

<p>For a first glimpse, watch our video:</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20377509 "></iframe></div></p>

<p>As of today, both iPhone and Android users can download the apps from the Apple App Store respectively the Android Marketplace. Here are the links:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/econ2011iphone">EclipseCon 2011 iPhone App</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/econ2011android">EclipseCon 2011 Android App</a></li>
</ol>


<p>If you don't own an iPhone or Android, you can always use the HTML-only version of the conference program available at <a href="http://bit.ly/econ2011html">http://bit.ly/econ2011html</a>.</p>

<p>The iPad and BlackBerry apps will be available soon, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>By the way, if <strong>you</strong> run a conference and are interested in having an app like this, <a href="http://mobile.itemis.com">get in touch with us</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://peterfriese.github.io/eclipse-democamp-hamburg-november-2010/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-15T08:28:17+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://peterfriese.github.io/eclipse-democamp-hamburg-november-2010</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Friday was a happy day for Java developers in Hamburg: not only did Apple and Oracle announce their plan to continue development of Java on the Mac OSX platform, but we also had the pleasure to host this fall's instance of Eclipse DemoCamp Hamburg in a bookstore!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We had a nice lineup of four speakers - unfortunately not all of them were able to attend due to a cold, but we were lucky enough to find one additional speaker - thanks Jan!</p>

<p>After a casual meet-and-greet with <a href="http://www.fritz-kola.de/">Fritz Kola</a> and Pretzels, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/robilad">Dalibor Topic</a> opened the official part of the evening with an overview of what's coming up in JDK7 and JDK8. Here's a list of things that sound quite interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Support for dynamically-typed languages (InvokeDynamic) (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm">project page</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Small language enhancements (Project Coin) (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/coin/">project page</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>An even newer NIO (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nio/">project page</a>)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The good news of the day of course was a <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/2010/11/oracle_and_apple_announce_openjdk_project_for_osx.html">press release announcing OpenJDK for Mac OSX</a>. Nevertheless, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/robilad/status/3129373515321344">Dalibor demoed a freshly built OpenJDK 7 BSD port</a> on his MacBook.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/IMG_0792.jpg"><img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/IMG_0792.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>After a short break, it was <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/author/rsternberg/">Ralf Sternberg's turn</a> to give an overview of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/">RAP</a> and explain what Single Sourcing is. With the help of RAP, it is rather easy to bring Eclipse RCP applications to the web. Of course, you'll have to pay attention to a few things, as Ralf pointed out: usually, RCP applications are single-user apps, whereas web applications are inherently multi-user enabled. Fortunately, RAP comes with a few utilities that cater for this fact.</p>

<p>One thing I was delighted to learn: not only do RAP applications run on the iPad, but also do they support drawing using the SWT API, as you can see in the following video:</p>

<p>In the last sessions, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/">Xtext</a> committer <a href="http://koehnlein.blogspot.com/">Jan Köhnlein</a> showed us some of the things coming up in Xtext 2.0. Being text-addicted, Jan refrained from using slides and used the IDE instead to deliver his talk:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/IMG_0804.jpg" alt="Jan Köhnlein talking about Xbase and Xtext" /></p>

<p>Jan showed us how Xbase (no, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbase">xBase</a>) can be used to develop DSLs (and even GPLs) that not only describe structural features but also behavior. He also demoed Xdoc, a newly invented documentation language, and the fancy new Xtext syntax view (featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram">railroad diagrams</a>).</p>

<p>After the demoes, we had some time for chats and impromptu hack sessions. Given the event took place in a book store (many thanks to Lehmanns for having us!), you could also browse and buy books.</p>

<p>Thanks to the fact we only had about 40 attendees, there were plenty of chances for networking which people really seemed to enjoy.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank everybody who attended the DemoCamp or gave a demo! <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/peterfriese">Follow me on twitter</a> to be informed ahead of time for the next DemoCamp!</p>

    <link href="http://peterfriese.github.io/updated-use-your-iphone-android-or-blackberry-to-build-your-eclipse-summit-europe-2010/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I'm writing this, Eclipse Summit Europe 2010 is merely hours away and everyone is getting excited to get there and meet Eclipse family.</p>

<p>I think the program committee have done a great job at putting together an exciting conference program with lots of technical sessions, interactive tutorials and inspiring keynotes.</p>

<p>As a special treat for smart phone users, we're offering a conference schedule app for iPhone, Android and all other smart phones that come with a browser. <!-- more -->Besides reviewing the <strong>conference schedule</strong> and getting to know the <strong>speakers</strong> you can use the apps to create your very <strong>own personal conference schedule</strong>. Usually, conference attendees will use the printed conference program to mark their favorite talks - and then leave their personalized copy of the program in their hotel room or elsewhere in the conference halls!</p>

<p>This will probably not happen with the smart phone app, although I can recall somebody lost their iPhone at this year's EclipseCon...</p>

<p>Without further ado, here's a preview of the iPhone app in action:</p>

<p>You can download the <strong>iPhone app</strong> from the App Store. It is available world-wide and we already have a few downloads from Singapore, Korea and India! For your convenience, <a href="http://bit.ly/ese_app_intl">here's the link to the app</a>.</p>

<p>We also prepared a version for <strong>Android</strong> users. Here's how it will look like on your Android device:
<img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/ESE_Android.png" alt="ESE_Android.png" /></p>

<p>Head over to the Android Marketplace and search for "eclipse summit", or use your barcode scanner:</p>

<p><img src="http://fs01.androidpit.info/aqr/x16/1078516-1288452914800.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <strong>mobile web app</strong> <del>will be available from the Wifi landing page at the conference venue</del> is available via the following URL: <a href="http://bit.ly/ese_app_mobile2">http://bit.ly/ese_app_mobile2/</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/mobileweb3.png" alt="mobileweb.png" /></p>

<p><del>Rumor has it even BlackBerry users will get a native app.</del> <a href="http://ekkescorner.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/ese-app-for-blackberry/">Ekke</a> has created a native app for BlackBerry.</p>

<p>Using these applications, you'll be able to put together <strong>your Eclipse Summit Europe 2010</strong> in no time. Enjoy!</p>

<p>The iPhone, Android and mobile web apps have been built by a dedicated team of software engineers at itemis I have the pleasure to work with. If you want to learn how we build applications like these, attend our sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tuesday, 14:00 - <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2010/sessions/?page=sessions&amp;id=1940">Mobile Development Symposium</a></p></li>
<li><p>Thursday 10:30 - <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2010/sessions/?page=sessions&amp;id=1733">Models To Go: How We Built a DSL for Mobile Apps With Tools From the Eclipse</a></p></li>
</ul>
