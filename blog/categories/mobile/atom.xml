    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code Generation 2011 is <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/index.php">just around the corner</a> and if you haven't booked yet, <a href="http://evbk.software-acumen.com/makebooking.php?event=CG2011">you should hurry up</a> - a few places are still available!</p>

<p>Quite a number of my colleagues at itemis have been busy preparing for this conference in the past few weeks. Besides working hard to hit the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Indigo/Simultaneous_Release_Plan">Eclipse Release Train milestone for Indigo on June 22nd</a>, the Xtext team brushed up their hands-on sessions "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=17">Xtext Take I: Creating Code Generators with Xtend2</a>" and "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=16">Xtext Take II: Crafting Domain Specific Languages with Xtext and Xbase</a>". If you've been using Xtext, you're well aware of the power you have at your disposal with this tool. Xbase and Xtend2, however, take this experience to a whole new level. So make sure to mark your calendar for these two sessions!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But not only the Xtext team will share their expertise at CG2011 - Markus and Karsten will be also be in town to give hands-on tutorials and report from their experience:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=22">Type Systems for DSLs (Markus Völter)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=8">Graphiti + Xtext: mixing graphical and textual DSLs for sprayers/designers (Karsten Thoms / Bernhard Merkle)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=5">Introduction to JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS) (Markus Völter)</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The finale of the conference will be a panel discussion hosted by Markus on the topic of "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=20">Models, DSLs, Transformations: The Next 5 years</a>" - this should be a very interesting and lively discussion!</p>

<p><a href="http://lanyrd.com/people/hbehrens/">Heiko</a> <a href="http://lanyrd.com/people/peterfriese/">and I</a> will present "<a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=28">Cross-Platform Mobile Development with DSLs</a>" - a <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/cg2011/sdpgm/">fast-paced and fun mixture of slides, live coding (or modeling, if you will), videos and audience interaction</a>. Yes, that's right - the audience will be part of the show. Make sure to bring your web-enabled mobile phone and get the chance to win a price!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the huge success of the mobile apps for Eclipse Summit Europe, we decided to provide mobile apps for EclipseCon 2011, too. So instead of using a printed copy of the conference program, you can browse the schedule on your smart phone - wherever you are!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This year, we're providing a rather impressive lineup of mobile apps for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad (thanks to <a href="http://www.compeople.eu/blog/?p=786">Christian Campo who created a stand-alone iPad app</a>), BlackBerry (<a href="http://ekkes-apps.org/">Ekke is working on a updated version, AFAIK</a>), and all other smart phones that feature a browser.</p>

<p>All apps allow you to browse the program, select your favorite talks and get to know the speakers (with headshots so you recognise them in the hallways). We also have included maps of the convention center as well as Santa Clara.</p>

<p>For a first glimpse, watch our video:</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20377509 "></iframe></div></p>

<p>As of today, both iPhone and Android users can download the apps from the Apple App Store respectively the Android Marketplace. Here are the links:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/econ2011iphone">EclipseCon 2011 iPhone App</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/econ2011android">EclipseCon 2011 Android App</a></li>
</ol>


<p>If you don't own an iPhone or Android, you can always use the HTML-only version of the conference program available at <a href="http://bit.ly/econ2011html">http://bit.ly/econ2011html</a>.</p>

<p>The iPad and BlackBerry apps will be available soon, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>By the way, if <strong>you</strong> run a conference and are interested in having an app like this, <a href="http://mobile.itemis.com">get in touch with us</a>.</p>

    <id>http://www.peterfriese.de/three-reasons-why-i-think-the-hp-touchpad-will-rock-the-tablet-market</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/09/hp-posts-complete-think-beyond-event-video/">HP introduced</a> the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/pads/touchpad/index.html">Touchpad</a>, an <del>iPad-like</del> tablet device that is programmed with web technologies. While this certainly isn't the first attempt of a vendor to compete with Apple on the tablet market, I am convinced the TouchPad is a true challenger to the iPad. There are three reasons why the TouchPad might be a real contender: the programming environment, the manufacturing process and security.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>HP is definitely doing something right. Never before has one single Tablet thrilled the interwebs as much as the TouchPad - except for the iPad, of course. Even <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2011/02/09/hp-makes-google-look-even-more-creaky/">die-hard Apple</a> fans are thrilled.</p>

<p>Here's why I think HP's TouchPad will score a considerable market share:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's programmed with web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Don't get me wrong - the iPad can also be programmed with web technologies: when the iPhone was first released and no one but Apple was allowed to write native apps, Steve himself told everyone that "mobile web applications are the future". And despite the fact Apple has opened it's SDK and we can now program the iPad / iPhone in Objective-C, many developers are more interested in writing apps with web technologies. Tools like PhoneGap and Appcelerator try to alleviate this situation, basically allowing you to wrap web code in more or less tiny wrapper apps so your web apps can be submitted to the App Store. However, most apps written using web technologies do not feel the same as real native apps on the iOS platform. So why do I think the situation will be better on the TouchPad? Well, because the TouchPad has been built for running web-based apps! It has been optimized for it. Web apps look stunningly great on the TouchPad. Now, every web developer can download the webOS SDK and get started writing apps for the TouchPad. It's a safe bet to assume there are more web developers out there than Objective-C developers, so it shouldn't take long until we've got a similar amount of apps for the TouchPad as we've got for the iPad.</p></li>
<li><p>The manufacturing process. HP has a very powerful production pipeline, capable of pumping out high volumes of devices. In <a href="http://www.itchannelplanet.com/trends/article.php/3920936/Gartner-Global-PC-Shipments-Total-351-Million-Units-in-2010-Gain-138-Percent-US-Q4-PC-Market-Slides-Nearly-7-Percent.htm">Q4/2010, they shipped 17.6</a> million PCs (<a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/01/18results.html">Apple sold 7.33 million iPads</a> in the same quarter). So if they are serious about it, it should be easy for HP to both produce and distribute high volumes of TouchPads.</p></li>
<li><p>Security. When it comes to enterprise computing, security becomes a vital feature of your product. CIOs need to make sure to not compromise their company's security by introducing products and devices that have no proper support for security mechanisms. There have always been <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/07/iphone-encryption/">security concerns</a> with respect to the iOS platform: for a long time, there hasn't been a way to nuke a lost iOS device remotely. <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4175">It wasn't before iOS 4</a> that Apple introduced data protection APIs to secure data that apps store on the device. <a href="">WebOS has several security features built in</a> (not bolted on later) which make it rather attractive for enterprise computing right from the start.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It's my firm belief that the release of the HP TouchPad is a milestone for the perception of personal computing in the long run. It looks great, we'll see tons of great apps for it in no time and HP as a major computer vendor has the power to push it to the market.</p>

<p>Good-bye, PC.</p>
