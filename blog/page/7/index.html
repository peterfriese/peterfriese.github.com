  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p><a href="http://jeff.over.bz/">Jeffrey Overbey</a> talked about building refactoring tools using the LTK and his research work &#8220;Ludwig&#8221;.</p>

<p>I guess you all agree with me that refactoring support is crucial for any programing language, as you need to restructure your code rom time to time.</p>

<p>Although Eclipse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-LTK/ltk.html">LTK</a> offers a decent <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/stable/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ltk/core/refactoring/package-summary.html">API</a> and UI to realize refactoring tools, all the heavy lifting (parsing the text in question, analyzing the AST, creating rewrite rules) is left to you.</p>

<p>Jeff&#8217;s research tool Ludwig can help to derive refactoring support from a BNF-style grammar very easily. Ludwig essentially derives a lexer/parser from the grammar and provides an interface to the AST which gets constructed by the parser. Which gives you the chance to walk / visit the AST and (partially) rewrite the AST.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Jeff&#8217;s presentation style. He used a set of slides and pre-recorded screenvideos to drive his talk. I think this is great idea, as it basically eliminates any problems you might run into if you do a live demo. Plus, it gives the presenter the chance to face the audience while demoing, instead of mumbling into the screen :-)</p>

    <p>On November 10th, the Hamburg Eclipse DemoCamp took place in the <a href="http://east-hamburg.de/">stylish EAST Hotel</a>.

<p>We had 45 reservations and almost all of them made it to the Camp. I always get a little bit nervous 15 minutes before the event starts if no more than 10 people have shown up so far, but I guess that&#8217;s alright.</p>

<p>Martin and I welcomed the crowd on behalf of our sponsors <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">(Eclipse Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.froglogic.com/">froglogic</a>, <a href="http://www.it-agile.de/">it-agile</a> and <a href="http://www.itemis.de">itemis</a>):

<p>After that, Harald Wellmann of Harman Becker told us that the world is a disc. Well, at least he and his company try to make it a disc again - Harald leads a team that develops a so called &#8220;map compiler&#8221;. A map compiler takes map source data and condenses that data by extracting only the relevant parts of it. As you may guess this is a long-running process which can hugely benefit from parallelization. Harald and his team use OSGi to modularize their software and make sure they use computing resources efficiently. One thing worth noting is that OSGi is even being used in car entertainment systems: Harald told us about one entertainment system which makes use of OSGi to act as an intermediate / glue layer between the UI (written in Java) and the core (written in C++).

<p><a href="http://gerd-wuetherich.de">Gerd Wütherich</a> (Independent) continued where Harald stopped and showed us how to use Spring Dynamic Modules and OSGi in his excellent talk - interspersed with some neat demos:

Together with Nils Hartmann, Mathias Lübken and Bernd Kolb, he wrote the   first German book on OSGi, so he really knows what he is talking about.</p>

<p>After those talks, we took a break to grab some refreshments and take the chance to get in touch with the other attending Eclipse enthusiasts. I had the impression that everybody had a good time discussing all things Eclipse - in fact Martin and I had to interrupt a lot of lively discussions for the second run of talks.</p>

<p>In the first talk after the break, Miguel Garcia and Rakesh Prithiviraj (both Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg) gave us an update of their research on how to integrate LINQ (Language Integrated Queries) in Java:

<p>The final demo was deliverd by Stephan Herrmann who showed us Object Teams / Equinox, an amazing piece of software that can be used to re-use existing Eclipse plug-ins in an aspect-oriented way. To get an idea of how powerful this approach is, have a look at the following screenshot -  this is the JDT, but enhanced by Object Teams in order to support their very own syntax extensions for Java:

Everyone in the room was quite impressed with what is possible with Object Teams / Equinox, so you should check it out (<a href="http://www.objectteams.org/distrib/otdt.html">it&#8217;s available for free</a>). If you can manage to go the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Berlin">DemoCamp in Berlin</a>, you&#8217;ll have the chance to see it live.</p>

<p>The feedback we received from the attendees was great - some people even sent emails thanking us for organizing the event, so I guess the DemoCamp can be considered a success!</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s that time of year again - demo time!</p>

<p>Being run for the third time, <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008">demo camps</a> can be considered an integral part of the Eclipse calender of events. Attending a DemoCamp is great. If you haven&#8217;t yet been to any <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008">Eclipse DemoCamp</a>, let me briefly summarize why I think you should consider going to one:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>see cool technology in action (well, that&#8217;s the whole point of a <strong>Demo</strong>Camp, isn&#8217;t it)</p></li>
<li><p>get to know Eclipse-minded people from your area</p></li>
<li><p>have some frosty beverages and fingerfood (well, that actually depends on how the camp is organized)</p></li>
<li><p>see some exciting buildings from inside (again, depends on how the camp is organized)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Oh, did I mention that Eclipse DemoCamps are free? Thanks to the Eclipse Foundation and many sponsoring member companies, you get to enjoy all those nice things for absolutely free.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite demos:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jingwen Owen Ou on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/SOC/A_Wiki_Integrated_Task_Editor">WikiText for Mylyn</a></p></li>
<li><p>Jochen Krause on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Karlsruhe#Presenters">Eclipse 4.0</a></p></li>
<li><p>Harald Wellmann on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Hamburg/Session_Abstracts#Europe_on_a_Disk_-_Geodata_Processing_for_Car_Navigation_Systems">Geodata Processing for Car Navigation Systems</a></p></li>
<li><p>Florian Fieber and Max Bureck on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Leipzig#Presenters">From Model to Code - A Comparison of M2M and M2T Technologies in Eclipse Modeling</a></p></li>
<li><p>Dave Savage on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/London#Presenters">Newton - a distributed OSGi application runtime</a></p></li>
<li><p>Jens von Pilgrim on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Berlin#Presenters">GEF goes 3D: GEF3D</a></p></li>
<li><p>Eike Steppe on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Berlin#Presenters">CDO Model Repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>Boris Bokowski and Eric Moffatt on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Ottawa#Presenters">the e4 Programming Model and e4 Modeled UI</a>, respectively</p></li>
<li><p>Martin Taal on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Nieuwegein#Presenters">EMF/Teneo</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>By the way, if we were to award the price of the most indefatigable DemoCamp presenter, it&#8217;d go to Wassim Melhem. You can meet him at no less than three locations: Iasi (Romania), Warszawa (Poland), Poznan (Poland).</p>

<p>Hope I could convince you to attend one of the many DemoCamps. I&#8217;ll be at the DemoCamps in <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, so see you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>From October 15 to October 17, <a href="http://mdsd08.techjava.de">MDSD Today 2008</a> took place at the <a href="http://www.nordakademie.de">Nordakademie</a> in <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=elmshorn,+k%C3%B6llner+chaussee+11&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=53.753973,9.672866&amp;spn=0.001922,0.005686&amp;t=h&amp;z=18">Elmshorn</a> near Hamburg, Germany. The conference, which had been organized by <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Frank_Zimmermann74">Frank Zimmermann</a> (Nordakademie), <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Simon_Zambrovski">Simon Zambrovski</a> and <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Peter_Friese">yours truly</a>, was intended to bring together practioners, researchers and people from both industry and business.</p>

<p>We were fortunate enough to aquire a number of well-known speakers, most notably <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Axel_Uhl">Axel Uhl</a> (SAP) and <a href="http://ed-merks.blogspot.com/">Ed Merks</a> (of EMF fame).</p>

<p>On the first day, Axel and Ed delivered their excellent keynotes on the current state of affairs in modeling.</p>

<p>[</p>

<p>Ed commented on a number of misconceptions he has been confronted with during the last few years such as &#8220;modeling is too complicated&#8221;, &#8220;modeling will just get into my way&#8221; or &#8220;modeling will limit my creativity&#8221;. The bottom line of his talk was that although you might not realize it, models drive most software (just think of all the data models you&#8217;re dealing with in business applications). However, using source code as a representation for your models might not always be the best solution - to gain both a better overview of your software and be more efficient with respect to software development, you should think about raising the level of abstraction, e.g. by using domain specific modeling tools that let you focus on the structure of your model instead of having to deal with (basically irrelevant) syntactical details of the target language. If working at a higher level of abstraction makes things more complicated for you, you&#8217;re doing something wrong.</p>

<p>[</p>

<p>Axel picked up this idea in his keynote on &#8220;Current Challenges for Industrial Software Development Tools and Languages&#8221; stating that any computer program can be conceived as a model. Since models are independent of their visual representation, they can be represented in various different forms, the most common being text, trees and diagrams of any kind. The question, however, whether to choose text or the abstract model as the primary artifact for storing. A textual representation clearly has advantages with respect to diffing and merging and can be handled with commonly used tools such as CVS nd plain text editors. Using the abstract model as the primary artifact allows for overlapping partial views. Since this model can persisted in some kind of repository, access to the model very much feels like working with a database. In particular, there&#8217;s no need to parse any text back and forth between the model and an editor. The decision whether to store models as text or in a repository largely depends on boundary decisions, like the availability of the repository technology, the robustness of the mapping between the textual representation and the model, language characteristics, the number of developers who need to work on the model in parallel, the size of the software system built with the model and the life cycle of the software. Axel concluded that on one hand, modeling is not that much different from coding and that, on the other hand, DSLs are becoming increasingly important due to the complexity of UML.</p>

<p>One of the nice thing about conferences is you get to talk to people who are interested in the same topics as you are. MDSD Today has been no different - during the breaks you could see people involved in all kinds of discussions.</p>

<p>Later that day, <a href="http://www.wickedshell.net/blog/">Stefan Reichert</a> and Birger Garbe of <a href="http://www.lhsystems.com">Lufthansa Systems</a> shared their experiences regarding model driven software projects with us. The topic of their talk was &#8220;Model Driven Software Development in Business Projects: Chance or Risk?&#8221; Their anwser to this question was that if&#8217;ve got the right tools, MDSD is a chance and can help you to build better software.</p>

<p>The second and third day of the conference were crammed with hands-on tutorials on MDSD tools like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">EMF</a>, <a href="http://www.xtext.org">Xtext</a>, <a href="http://www.openarchitectureware.org">Xpand</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmf/">GMF</a>. Quite a lot of people attended the tutorials as you can see from the pictures.</p>

<p>Arno had to overcome the hardship of a broken beamer, so he had to use arms and legs to explain:</p>

<p>Overall, the conference was a real success and I am looking forward to seeing you all again at MDSD Today 2009!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/eclipse-on-macos/">Yesterday, I complained</a> about large fonts being used in Eclipse runtime instances on Mac OS X. Much to my delight, <a href="http://mea-bloga.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> was kind enough to point out that you can define a launch configuration template for PDE-based launches. It is a bit hidden and doesn&#8217;t have the &#8220;launch&#8221; keyword assigned. To globally define launch config parameters, open the preference dialog and navigate to Plug-in Development -> Target Platform -> Launching Arguments:</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_130&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Launch template for PDE launches&#8221;]<a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/launchtemplate.png"><img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/launchtemplate.png" alt="Launch template for PDE launches" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>After ou have defined your favourite launching arguments, subsequently created launch configurations will be initialized with these arguments:
[caption id=&#8221;attachment_133&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Launch configuration&#8221;]<a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/launchconfig.png"><img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/launchconfig.png" alt="Launch configuration" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Who would have thought you can learn something by just <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=249179">filing a bug</a>?</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>By default, runtime instances of Eclipse will start with large fonts. To get rid of this behaviour, just add <code>-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts</code> to the VM arguments of the respective launch configuration.</p>

<p>I guess it might be a good idea if PDE UI could transparently add this parameter to Eclipse launch configurations - I <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=249179">opened a bug</a> to get this fixed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Microsoft <a href="http://clemensreijnen.nl/post/2008/09/Microsoft-joins-the-OMGhellip%3b.aspx">seem to be</a> <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/dbox/archive/2008/09/06/oslo.aspx">quite excited</a> about modeling these days. Just recently, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/sep08/09-10OMGModelingPR.mspx">they announced that</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/archive/2008/09/11/microsoft-joins-the-omg.aspx">they have joined the OMG</a>. OMG does NOT stand for Old Modeling Guys, but for <a href="http://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group</a>. This is the standards body that brought you specifications like <a href="http://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a>, <a href="http://www.uml.org/">UML</a>, <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda/">MDA</a> and <a href="http://www.omg.org/bpmn-logo/">BPMN</a>, to name just a few.</p>

<p>But Microsoft does not just talk about modeling, they also put their money where their mouth is: during the last few years, a number of people including <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/">Steve</a> <a href="http://www.domainspecificdevelopment.com/Bios/SteveCook.aspx">Cook</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/">Stuart</a> <a href="http://www.domainspecificdevelopment.com/Bios/StuartKent.aspx">Kent</a> have been working on a toolchain which first has seen the light of day under the somewhat cryptic name <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vsx/cc677256.aspx">VSX DSL Tools</a>.</p>

<p>VSXDSL Tools are really good at rapidly creating (simple) graphical modeling tools. However, when it came to model transformations and code generation, you were stuck with a somewhat dated technology called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx">T4 (Text Templating Transformation Toolkit)</a> - a template language quite similar to JSP and ASP. <a href="http://www.olegsych.com/2007/12/text-template-transformation-toolkit/">T4</a> seriously lacks some important features, like polymorphic dispatch, support for multiple file output and - believe it or not - a decent editor. Well, you can get one from <a href="http://www.t4editor.net/">http://www.t4editor.net/</a>, but who likes to shell out 99 dollars for just an editor?</p>

<p>Now, Microsoft seem to have listened to their users and are coming up with an updated and extended version of the DSL Tools, code-named Oslo.</p>

<p>So what is Oslo? <a href="http://douglaspurdy.com/2008/09/06/what-is-oslo/">Douglas Purdy states that Oslo is</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>_A tool that helps people define and interact with models in a rich and visual manner _</p></li>
<li><p>_A language that helps people create and use textual domain-specific languages and data models _</p></li>
<li><p><em>A relational repository that makes models available to both tools and platform components  Looks to me like they are addressing all the issues MS DSL tools had.</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>At <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC 2008</a>, the team will reveal Oslo and all its nice features.</p>

<p>Although I am an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pde/pde-ui/committers/committers.php#contributors">Eclipse fan</a> and an <a href="http://www.openarchitectureware.org/">openArchitectureWare</a> committer, I am quite thrilled so see Microsoft make this move to embrace modeling. In my opinion, this will advance MDSD and DSLs quite a deal. A lot of people who may have never heard of DSLs and MDSD will now get in touch with those techniques due to the sheer marketing power of Microsoft. This will also bring some nice competition to the market, which always is a Good Thing (tm).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/sep08/09-10OMGModelingPR.mspx">press release</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/architectsrule/archive/2008/09/10/microsoft-joins-omg.aspx">states that</a> &#8220;to make model-driven development a reality, Microsoft is focused on providing a model-driven platform and visual modeling tools [&#8230;]&#8221;  - So, welcome to the modeling world, Microsoft!</p>

    <p>In IT, you can tell the season by counting the number of conferences per month. No doubt fall is around the corner, taking into account how many Eclipse-related events are taking place this month.</p>

<p>If you happen to be interested in OSGi (most Eclipse developers should be, as OSGi is one of the corner stones of the Eclipse Platform), consider attending the OSGi tutorial with Peter Kriens (OSGi Technical Director) and Matthias Lübken (who co-authored the first (german) book on OSGi) next week in Hamburg.</p>

<p>After the tutorial, Peter will give a talk titled &#8220;OSGi: Why Modularity is Important&#8221;.</p>

<p>When:</p>

<p>September 9th, 2008
14:30 - 18:00 (Tutorial)
19:00 (Talk)</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.east-hamburg.de/">East Hotel Hamburg</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Yesterday, the seconds Eclipse Stammtisch in Hamburg took place. About twenty Eclipse-addicts showed up to talk about all things Eclipse over <a href="http://www.fritz-kola.de/">some</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer">frosty</a> beverages and delicious <a href="http://www.roxie-hamburg.com/">Roxie-style</a> food.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2820232477_0fbb17a57a_m.jpg" alt="Peter, Martin, Karsten" /></p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3246/2820239717_824a1098e8_m.jpg" alt="Ralph" /></p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3057/2821076594_e313df5ee7_m.jpg" alt="More Eclipse Enthusiasts, including Sebastian and Miguel" /></p>

<p>I had some very intersting conversations about topics like</p>

<ul>
<li><p>potential analysis of public transport</p></li>
<li><p>wood chemistry and how to use Eclipse technology to detect smudges in paper machines</p></li>
<li><p>how to find the best seat on your next flight (check out <a href="http://www.seatguru.com">seatguru.com</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>and of course, <a href="http://www.xtext.org">textual DSLs</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>As you can guess from the topics, we had participants from a very diverse range of industries and fields of study. I guess that&#8217;s a sign for a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<p>Ralph and I talked about the evolution of the Eclipse ecosystem and the rise and fall of companies. We both agreed that companies who want to gain benefits from the Eclipse ecosystem are well advised to invest into their staff, making sure their developers, architects, projects leads and product managers are well-connected with the community.</p>

<p>Networking is becoming more and more important and events like the Eclipse Stammtisch and Eclipse DemoCamps make it easy to get to know other like-minded people.</p>

<p>If you are interested in participating in the next Eclipse Stammtisch in Hamburg, just <a href="mailto:peter.friese@itemis.de?subject=Eclipse%20Stammtisch%20Hamburg">drop me a short mail with the subject line &#8220;Eclipse Stammtisch Hamburg&#8221;</a> and I&#8217;ll send you an invitation for the next Stammtisch in time.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way: I&#8217;d love to see some Eclipse enthusiasts from companies like OTTO, Adobe and Google next time ;-)</p>
