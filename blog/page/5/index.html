    <p>Whether it was just pure coincidence or destiny - yesterdays <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Galileo_2009/Hamburg">DemoCamp</a> in Hamburg happened to fall on the same day as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_day">Towel Day</a>.</p>

<p>Although we had quite a bunch of <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Galileo_2009/Hamburg#Who_Is_Attending">attendees (I counted 40)</a>, only one brought his Towel.</p>

<p>Thanks to our speakers, Martin and I were able to put together a really exciting program:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Moritz Eysholdt, Patching Models and Evolving Meta Models</p></li>
<li><p>Heiko Behrens, TMF Xtext</p></li>
<li><p>Simon Zambrovski, Common Navigator Framework</p></li>
<li><p>Marco Mosconi, Modular EMF/GMF customization with ObjectTeams/Java</p></li>
<li><p>Markus Alexander Kuppe, Distributed OSGi (RFC 119) - The ECF way</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Moritz presented the result of his master&#8217;s thesis on the topic of metamodel evolution and explained how models can evolve together with their metamodels. This might also be of interest for data modeling.</p>

<p>Heiko delivered a great presentation on the upcoming version of Xtext. He used a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/HeikoB/xtext-und-was-man-damit-anstellen-kann">well-known example</a> that everybody could relate to (no, not entities and services!) so it was really easy to understand how domain specific languages work and how Xtext can help to implement a domain specific tool chain.</p>

<p>Simon presented on the Common Navigator Framework - a powerful framework which helps you to assemble tree views in a mostly declarative manner. Simon was bold enough to do a live coding session, but the <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/DemoGods/">demo gods</a> didn&#8217;t smile on him, so he showed us the prepared solution, which was still very convincing. Simon prepared an article about the CNF on his blog, so if you&#8217;re interested, <a href="http://www.techjava.de/topics/2009/04/eclipse-common-navigator-framework/">drop by</a> - it&#8217;s worth a read.

<p>After the break, Marco Mosconi showed how <a href="http://www.objectteams.org/">ObjectTeams/Java</a> can be used to non-invasively customize generated code. As a real-world example he used the UML diagrams from the Eclipse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2tools">UML2Tools</a> project. The <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2Tools">UML2Tools</a> project uses <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmf/">GMF</a> to generate the diagram code based on the UML2 metamodel (implemented as an ECore model). A rather large number of generated artifacts have to be customized to make sure the diagrams behave correctly. Marco showed how this is especially required for associations (I find it kind of funny how everybody uses associations to explain how complicated the UML metamodel is). The UML2Tools class diagram has been customized in at least 200 different locations, so you get a big maintenance problem (generated and non-generated code are mingled). With ObjectTeams, it is possible to extract all customization code into so called teams which then are able to enhance the generated code in an aspect oriented way. In a way, ObjectTeams is like AOP on steroids.

<p>The official part of the DemoCamp was concluded by a talk held by <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/lemmy">Markus</a> <a href="http://www.lemmster.de/blog/">Kuppe</a> on Distributed OSGi. Markus briefly explained the architecture behind Distributed OSGi and gave a demo of an Eclipse RCP application that communicated with an iPhone (which ran an Equinox server). Markus used the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/">Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF)</a> to achieve this - ECF contains a provider for Distributed OSGi.

<p>Eclipse DemoCamps are social events and aim at creating room for discussion and interaction. So, after the official part of the DemoCamp, we headed down to the EAST Bar to have some nice chats over some frosty beverages (I definitely recommend &#8220;Cool Mango&#8221;).</p>

<p>Feedback has been very positive so far and I surely hope everybody enjoyed the DemoCamp as much as I did. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.it-agile.de/">it-agile</a> and <a href="http://www.itemis.com/">itemis</a> for making this event possible by sponsoring the location and the drinks!</p>

<p>If you feel you missed out, drop <a href="http://twitter.com/peterfriese">me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/martinlippert">Martin</a> a mail so we can invite you the next time around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Last week, <a href="http://www.1160pm.net/">Heiko</a>, <a href="http://koehnlein.blogspot.com/">Jan</a> and I were talking about blogging about the tools that make our lifes easier on the Mac. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the Mac supposed to be making your life easier anyway?&#8221; you might ask. Well, most things really are easy with a Mac. However, there are some things that cannot be done easily with a Mac. More often than not, this is due to the fact that Apple tries to hide the complexity of computers from nosy users. Which is fine for beginners - but makes life harder for the pros. Thankfully, there is a vast array of tools out there that fill the gap and make life on a Mac easier.</p>

<p>I am going to try to post one tool recommendation per week - unless I am on vacation or speaking at a conference.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here is the first tool: <a href="http://www.skitch.com/">Skitch</a>!</p>

<p>Skitch is a tool that helps you to create screenshots. I need to create lots of screenshots: for documentation, to explain things to people by mail, and to annotate my bug reports. Of course, Mac OSX has several shortcuts to create screenshots, so what&#8217;s the deal about Skitch?</p>

<p>First of all, Skitch allows you to view and edit your screenshot: press CMD+SHIFT+5, select the capture area and voilà - Skitch opens a window showing the screenshot just taken:
[</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2469/3560151513_31ff0b4529.jpg" alt="Skitch itself" /></p>

<p>](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81029262@N00/3560151513)</p>

<p>You can now use the tools at the left hand side of the Skitch window to highlight certain areas of the screenshot, which comes on handy if you&#8217;re filing a bug report for your favorite open source tool.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re done with editing, you can either drag the image to another application (using the &#8220;drag me&#8221; tab at the bottom of the window) or you can post the image to the web. I have set up Skitch to use my Flickr account, so I can use the images in other tools right away (I am writing my blog posts in Mars Edit, which has a great Flickr integration, so I&#8217;ve got a complete tool chain here). Skitch supports a number of file formats (JPG, SVG, PDF, TIF, GIF, BMP and native Skitch), so you can select the desired file format before sending the image to the web or dragging it to another application.</p>

<p>All images are also stored in a local history, so if you need to go back to one of the screenshots you took a while ago, no problem with Skitch.</p>

<p>Skitch really has made my life on my Mac easier because it integrates with other tools (both online and offline) so well and because it eliminates many steps that made dealign with screenshots so cumbersome before.</p>

<p>You can download Skitch beta from <a href="http://www.skitch.com">http://www.skitch.com</a>. You will be asked to sign up, however, both the download and the software will work without registering.</p>

<p>Happy screen shooting :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>In my <a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/getting-started-with-wikitext/">recent posting</a>, I showed you how to use <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Incubator/WikiText">Mylyn WikiText</a> to easily create documentation for your project.</p>

<p>In this installment, we&#8217;re going to look at four things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How to create PDFs</p></li>
<li><p>How to automate your publishing process</p></li>
<li><p>How to split your documents to facilitate team work</p></li>
<li><p>How to use DocBook as an intermediary format to add even more flexibility to your publishing process</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Lots of stuff, so let&#8217;s get started!</p>

<h2>How to create PDFs</h2>

<p>The WikiText documentation states you can create DocBook, HTML and Eclipse Help from Wiki markup. So, how to create PDFs? Well, there are many ways to create PDFs. If you just want to create PDFs inside the IDE, you can download the <a href="https://textile-j.dev.java.net/builds/wikitext/index.html">Textile-J PDF add-on</a> for WikiText. Textile-J is the predecessor of WikiText. The reason why the PDF output is not included in WikiText is that some of the required frameworks need to transform to PDF are not yet IP-approved (see bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=258349">258349</a> for more information).</p>

<p>To install the Textile-J PDF add-on, proceed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you have WikiText 1.1.0 or better installed</p></li>
<li><p>Add the Textile-J update site to your Update Manager: <em>https://textile-j.dev.java.net/builds/wikitext/site</em></p></li>
<li><p>Refresh the Update Manager. You should now see <em>Textile-J WikiText PDF</em> in the list of available features.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <em>Textile-J WikiText PDF</em> and click <em>Install</em></p></li>
<li><p>Restart Eclipse as requested</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You can now right-click on any wiki file (<em>*.textile</em>, <em>*.mediawiki</em>, <em>*.confluence</em>, <em>*.twiki</em>, <em>*.tracwiki</em> and select <em>Textile-J -> Generate PDF</em> from the context menu.</p>

<h2>How to automate the process</h2>

<p>If you want to create PDFs outside the IDE (e.g. on your CI server using ANT), you need to create a build file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;project name="how-to-use-wikitext" default="wikitext2pdf" basedir="."&gt;
&lt;property name="wikitext.standalone" value="lib"/&gt;&lt;!-- path to wikitext standalone package --&gt;
&lt;path id="wikitext.classpath"&gt;
&lt;fileset dir="${wikitext.standalone}"&gt;
&lt;include name="org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.*core*.jar"/&gt;
&lt;include name="net.java.dev.textilej.wikitext.*core*.jar"/&gt;
&lt;include name="net.java.dev.textilej.wikitext.*lib*.jar"/&gt;
&lt;/fileset&gt;
&lt;/path&gt;
&lt;taskdef classpathref="wikitext.classpath"
        resource="org/eclipse/mylyn/wikitext/core/util/anttask/tasks.properties" /&gt;
&lt;taskdef classpathref="wikitext.classpath"
        resource="net/java/dev/textilej/wikitext/pdf/core/util/anttask/tasks.properties" /&gt;
&lt;target name="wikitext2pdf" description="Generate PDF from textile"&gt;
&lt;wikitext-to-pdf markupLanguage="Textile"&gt;
&lt;fileset dir="${basedir}"&gt;
&lt;include name="documentation.textile"/&gt;
&lt;/fileset&gt;
&lt;/wikitext-to-pdf&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, there are ANT tasks for all other output formats as well, so you can automate the creation of Eclipse Help, HTML and DocBook, too:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;wikitext-to-docbook markupLanguage="Textile"&gt;
&lt;fileset dir="${basedir}"&gt;
&lt;include name="documentation.textile"/&gt;
&lt;/fileset&gt;
&lt;/wikitext-to-docbook&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to split your documents to facilitate team work</h2>

<p>Now that you know how to transform Wiki markup to various output formats, you might wonder how to split your Wiki files into smaller chunks so the members of your team can work on them separately. This is something which is very easy with, say, LaTeX or DocBook because they both have the concept of importing other documents. In Wikis, there usually is no such thing as importing another Wiki page - you rather <em>link</em> to that other page. If you&#8217;re writing a documentation, this isn&#8217;t sufficient, however. You really need to be able to import document fragments.</p>

<p>Instead of adding the notion of imports to WikiText, I decided to control the assembling of the master document by using a little bit of ANT wizardry and a text file.</p>

<p>The text file (named <em>index.txt</em> controls the order in which the document fragments ned to be glued together:</p>

<pre><code>introduction.textile
grammar_language.textile
newnoteworthy.textile
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>build.xml</em> now needs to be enhanced so that it reads the control file and use this information to assemble the Wiki files in the order requested:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name="assemble"&gt;
&lt;loadfile srcfile="doc/index.txt" property="inputfiles"&gt;
&lt;filterchain&gt;
&lt;tokenfilter&gt;
&lt;replacestring from="\n" to=","/&gt;
&lt;/tokenfilter&gt;
&lt;/filterchain&gt;
&lt;/loadfile&gt;
&lt;concat destfile="documentation.textile" append="false" fixlastline="yes"&gt;
&lt;filelist dir="doc" files="${inputfiles}"/&gt;
&lt;/concat&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So what happens here is that we read in the contents of the <em>index.txt</em> file, concatenate all file names, separated with a comma to one large line and feed that large line into the <em>concatenate</em> task that will then concatenate the contents of all those files in the given order so we get one big file.</p>

<p>After that, the big file can now be processed as usual:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name="generate-pdf" depends="assemble" description="Generate PDF from textile"&gt;
&lt;wikitext-to-pdf markupLanguage="Textile"&gt;
&lt;fileset dir="${basedir}"&gt;
&lt;include name="documentation.textile"/&gt;
&lt;/fileset&gt;
&lt;/wikitext-to-pdf&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to use DocBook to gain more flexibility</h2>

<p>DocBook has been around for quite some years now and together with LaTeX still will give you the most flexibility when it comes to documentation engineering. I have been using both LaTeX and DocBook to write all sorts of documentation, ranging from my diploma thesis to open source project documentation and have found both the be versatile and reliable, but also quite verbose. Regarding flexibility, both give you the possibility to choose a document template / style of your liking. If none of the existing document styles match your needs, you can more or less easily create you own.</p>

<p>As WikiText supports creating DocBook from your Wiki files, we&#8217;ll have a look at how to use this DocBook output to further process it. Here is what we need to do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enhance our build script so it downloads the relevant DocBook files (libraries, basic styles and XSL transformations)</p></li>
<li><p>Add targets to our build script that allow you to choose the output to be created: PDF, HTML or Eclipse Help</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The whole process will look like this:
[</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3599/3494324023_c4cf66ba24_o.png" alt="WikiTextDocBook ToolChain" /></p>

<p>](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81029262@N00/3494324023)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at some crucial parts of the script.</p>

<p>We already saw how to assemble multiple Wiki files into one big Wiki file. The next step is to convert this file to DocBook:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name="wikitext2docbook" depends="assemble" description="Generate DocBook from textile"&gt;
&lt;wikitext-to-docbook markupLanguage="Textile"&gt;
&lt;fileset dir="${basedir}"&gt;
&lt;include name="documentation.textile"/&gt;
&lt;/fileset&gt;
&lt;/wikitext-to-docbook&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After that, we need to convert the DocBook file to PDF:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name="docbook2pdf"&gt;
&lt;echo&gt;Converting article to PDF...&lt;/echo&gt;
&lt;delete file="${dest.dir}${file.separator}${documenat.name}.pdf"/&gt;
&lt;delete file="${dest.dir}${file.separator}${documenat.name}.fo"/&gt;
&lt;xslt in="${documenat.name}.xml"
        extension="xml"
        out="${dest.dir}${file.separator}${documenat.name}.fo"
        style="${document.stylesheet}"&gt;
&lt;factory name="org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl"&gt;
&lt;attribute name="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/features/optimize" value="true"/&gt;
&lt;/factory&gt;
&lt;xmlcatalog&gt;
&lt;entity
                publicId="docbook.xsl"
                location="${docbook.dir}${file.separator}fo${file.separator}docbook.xsl"/&gt;
&lt;/xmlcatalog&gt;
&lt;param name="generate.toc" expression="book toc" /&gt;
&lt;param name="show.comments" expression="0" /&gt;
&lt;param name="header.rule" expression="1" /&gt;
&lt;param name="admon.graphics.extension" expression=".gif"/&gt;
&lt;param name="admon.textlabel" expression="0"/&gt;
&lt;param name="admon.graphics" expression="1"/&gt;
&lt;/xslt&gt;
&lt;docbook2pdf
        source="${dest.dir}${file.separator}${documenat.name}.fo"
        target="${dest.dir}${file.separator}${documenat.name}.pdf"/&gt;
&lt;delete file="${dest.dir}${file.separator}${documenat.name}.fo" /&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can now control the output by supplying different stylesheets. DocBook XSLT comes with a variety of stylesheets for articles, books and online help systems. You can now easily create printed documentation AND online help from one source. DocBook XSLT supports EclipseHelp, JavaHelp, HTMLHelp (the Windows Help System) and even man pages!</p>

<p>So, next time you need to write documentation for a project you&#8217;re working on, don&#8217;t let it get you down. Instead, set up a trusty WikiText / DocBook toolchain and write down that documentation in Wiki markup in no time!</p>

<p>The whole build script and the sample document are available for [drain file 17 url download] for free. If you need help setting up a tool chain or want to book me for consulting, drop me a line (peter dot friese at itemis dot com).</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/">David Green</a> and <a href="http://steffenpingel.de/">Steffen Pingel</a> of WikiText and Mylyn who tirelessly fixed bugs I found, applied patches and created EA builds!</p>

    <p>Documentation is the bane of all developers. Nobody likes to write documentation, but most people know we need it. Even more so in Open Source projects. If you don&#8217;t have a decent documentation, it will be hard to find contributors which will eventually stall the projects ability to acquire new committers.</p>

<p>While documenting code is discussed quite controversial (see <a href="http://twitter.com/peterfriese/status/1573456711">here</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/EelcoVisser/status/1573534530">here</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/peterfriese/status/1574872897">here</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/EelcoVisser/status/1575307114">here</a>), most people seem at least to agree that a high level documentation outlining the concepts of the software in question <strong>is</strong> appropriate.</p>

<p>The options to write high-level documentation are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Word processors like Word, OpenOffice, Pages and the like</p></li>
<li><p>LaTeX</p></li>
<li><p>DocBook</p></li>
<li><p>Wikis</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Using word processors for writing high-level documentation has serious drawbacks, especially when a whole team needs to contribute to the documentation. Do you remember <a href="http://word.mvps.org/fAQs/General/RecoverMasterDocs.htm">master documents</a>?</p>

<p>LaTeX is a great alternative, as it allows us to split documentation across several text files - this allows for efficient team work. Moreover, text files just cannot break and can be versioned / merged / diffed quite easily. However, LaTeX syntax is not for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>DocBook is great, too: it uses XML to describe documents and has a great number of transformations to about every output format you could think of (<a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/PrintOutput.html">PDF</a>, <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HtmlCustomEx.html">HTML</a>, <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/EclipseHelp.html">EclipseHelp</a>, <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HtmlHelp.html">HTML Help</a>, <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/JavaHelp.html">JavaHelp</a> and even <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/RefentryToMan.html">man pages</a>! However, not everybody likes XML and in fact DocBook tends to be a little noisy.</p>

<p>So this leaves us with Wikis. They are great in many regards: you can write your documentation online, most wikis support versioning and diffing to a certain degree and most wikis have a decent collision detection that helps to work on documentation collaboratively. Thanks to offline Wiki editors for IDEs, we can even store wiki documents in local files.</p>

<h2>Enter WikiText</h2>

<p><a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/FAQ#WikiText">WikiText</a> is such a tool. It actually is very flexible, as it allows you to use a multitude of wiki dialects to write your documentation. It also supports a number of output formats (HTML, Eclipse Help, DITA, DocBook and FOP). What&#8217;s more, it features a really nice text editor that can display Wiki markup almost in a WYSIWYG fashion. WikiText is developed and maintained by <a href="http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/">David Green</a>.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here is a quick introduction on how to install WikiText, writing your first document and transforming it to HTML.</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>Make sure you have a recent version of Eclipse installed. Then:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Point your update manager (<em>Help -> Install new software</em>) to the Mylyn Update Site (http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/weekly/e3.4)</p></li>
<li><p>Select the most recent version of Mylyn WikiText (as of this writing, this is WikiText 1.1.0.I20090423-1700-e3x) and install</p></li>
</ol>


<p>After the obligatory Eclipse restart, you can start using the WikiText editor.</p>

<h2>Writing your first document</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new project (<em>File -> Project&#8230; -> General -> Project</em></p></li>
<li><p>Create a new file. We will be using the <a href="http://textile.thresholdstate.com/">Textile</a> wiki syntax, so let&#8217;s name it <em>HelloWorld.textile</em></p></li>
<li><p>Enter some text:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>h1(#id). An HTML first-level heading

Textile syntax is really simple. You can _emphasize_ text or *emphasize it even more*.

Scaled images:
!{width: 50%}images/eiffelturm.jpg!

Enumerations also are very easy:

* An item in a bulleted (unordered) list
* Another item in a bulleted list
** Second Level
** Second Level Items
*** Third level

# An item in an enumerated (ordered) list 
# Another item in an enumerated list 
## Another level in an enumerated list 

Let's have more headings:

h2. An HTML second-level heading

Here is a table:

|_. Header |_. Header |_. Header |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 |

h2. An HTML third-level heading

Here is some code:

bc.. 
package org.eclipse.workflow;

public class Workflow {

}

p. Here is a plain old paragraph. It needs to start with "p." to mark the end of the code block above.


h4. An HTML fourth-level heading

Of course, we can also have hyperlinks: "Peter's homepage":http://www.peterfriese.de 

h5. An HTML fifth-level heading

h6. An HTML sixth-level heading
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Create a new subfolder <em>images</em> and place an image in his folder. I used <a href="http://www.wiemann.eu/1/eiffelturm.jpg">this</a> one.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can always switch over to the <em>preview</em> pane, but you will notice that the source editor already does a decent job at rendering the text in a kind of WYSIWYG manner:

<p>](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81029262@N00/3469612438)</p>

<h2>Transforming your document to HTML</h2>

<p>In order to convert your document to a nicely rendered HTML document, just right-click on <em>HelloWorld.textile</em> in the package explorer and select <em>WikiText -> Generate HTML</em>. This will create anew file <em>HelloWorld.html</em> in the same directory. Double-click it to open it with a browser:

<h2>Automating, PDF, splitting documents,&#8230;</h2>

<p>I hope I could whet your appetite. In the next installment, I am going to show you how to automate the process of transforming WikiText documents into output documents, how to create PDF (by way of exploiting DocBook) and how to split your documents into smaller chunks so you can work on them as a team. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Today, I wanted to migrate from Eclipse 3.5M5 to Eclipse 3.6M6 (I know, it&#8217;s a bit late for that already - but then, I had been busy with <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/">#eclipsecon</a> and preparing the <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009/sessions?id=358">Stupid Modeling Talk</a> during the past weeks).</p>

<p>As of course I&#8217;ve got quite a number of additional bundles installed (e.g., EMF, Window Builder, Mylyn, Xpand and Xtend), I wanted to re-use them. I recalled that a while back someone (probably Chris?) blogged that it basically is possible to use an existing Eclipse installation as a local update site. However, I couldn&#8217;t find the blog posting describing how to do that.</p>

<p>Given the fact it was about lunch time, I decided to let the #wisecrowd figure out how to solve my problem. So I twittered &#8221;<a href="http://twitter.com/peterfriese/statuses/1437609552">desperately looking for a hint how to use an existing Eclipse install as a P2 repo. Goal:transport features from my M5 install to a fresh M6</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, during my lunch break, the wise crowd (<a href="http://twitter.com/kaitoedter">Kai</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ekkescorner">Ekke</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bokowski">Boris</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/paulweb515">Paul</a>) sent me their opinions on the matter:</p>

<p>[</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3407041702_4b788ff887.jpg" alt="How Twitter solved my P2 problem during my lunch break" /></p>

<p>](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81029262@N00/3407041702)</p>

<p>At first, it seemed like there is no solution, but in the end Paul&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/paulweb515/status/1437925330">tweet</a> reveals the solution I was looking for:</p>

<p>Add eclipse/p2/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine/profileRegistry/SDKProfile.profile/ as a local update site.</p>

<p>All of you out there who still doubt the practical use of Twitter: you really should give it another try.</p>

    <p>So this is the last post I am writing in Canada for quite some time. I shall be heading back to Germany tonight on AC 876 - let&#8217;s see if they&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/o-canada/">disco lights</a> again :-)</p>

<p>It has been a packed time and I guess I met more people in these two months than I ever met before in a comparable period of time. Oh, did I tell you that I used to be a shy person? Well, at least I seem to have found ways to cope with that trait.</p>

<p>As I look back onto the past two months, here are some things that I really like about Canada:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People generally seem to be more open than people in Germany. This might of course be influenced by the fact that everybody uses their first names when communicating. I also have gotten used to the little &#8220;how are you today&#8221; conversation at the beginning of each transaction. Let&#8217;s see what happens when I try that on German shop assistants&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>Although (or maybe just because) it was winter when I came to Canada, I really like the landscape: the wide fields, the forests, the snow&#8230; Often, on my rides through Ontario, I would get the felling of somehow knowing how much greater it must be in summer.</p></li>
<li><p>I also like the fact you can go shopping almost any hour of day, any day of the week. In fact, I was surprised to hear that there are some stores that are not open 24/7 ;-)</p></li>
<li><p>Turning right on a red light. Very time-saving, I wonder why we don&#8217;t have this in Germany, as we&#8217;re said to be oh so efficient&#8230;</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The list of things I didn&#8217;t like too much is much shorter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tim Hortons coffee. Don&#8217;t go there. It tastes like metal. Besides, they do not know what Coffee Latte is. And don&#8217;t even try to get a Cappucino - it will be Vanilla-flavoured. Check out Second Cup instead - they have some decent coffee there and they know how to make a Latte.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a number of people that really have made my stay really memorable:</p>

<p>Thanks to Christian and Linda, Jeff and Nancy for so generously hosting me when I came to Ottawa.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ian, Mike and Wayne of the Eclipse Foundation for connecting me with so many people.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lynn for taking me on the Ottawa tour, that was a fun day out!

<p>Thanks to Peter and Gisela Weidelich and the fine people at the Sunnyvale Baptist Church for giving me a spiritual home for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Thanks to Simon and Anneta for spending Sunday before EclipseCon with me in San Francisco and for giving me a lift!

<p>Most of all, thanks to Ed Merks for hosting me at his place in the probably most difficult time of his life. Ed, I owe you.

<p>Oh, and thanks to everybody who reassured me that they couldn&#8217;t figure out where I come from by just listening to my dialect :-)</p>

<p>You all have given me a sense of being welcome to Canada. Although I am really looking forward to returning to Germany and seeing my family again, I am feeling like I am leaving a new family behind.</p>

    <p>Although <a href="http://kenn-hussey.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-death-of-eclipse-and-modeling.html">some people seem to be convinced</a> that <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/">Eclipse Modeling</a> are dead, I have been sensing quite healthy life signals of both on EclipseCon 2009 (or rather <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23eclipsecon">#eclipsecon</a>).</p>

<p>On Monday, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sza/3385548232/">Bernd</a>, <a href="http://kenn-hussey.blogspot.com/">Kenn</a> and I hosted the <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009/sessions?id=780">official Modeling BOF</a>:
[</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3648/3383866773_ffa5c03596.jpg" alt="Modeling BOF" /></p>

<p>](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81029262@N00/3383866773)
The topics discussed were focussing on consumability and long-term sustainability of EMF:</p>

<p><strong>Documentation and Marketing</strong></p>

<p>We all agreed that the entire modeling project lacks a decent documentation. While of course all of the projects and subprojects do have their own documentation, there is so such thing as an overview documentation. Modelers as we are, we quickly realized we&#8217;re lacking a documentation superstructure. The idea is to provide a guide for users (newbies and seasoned experts alike) to navigate the Eclipse Modeling world. The modeling project offers a great variety of technologies, so it is not always easy to find out which set of technologies / frameworks you might want to use - especially if you are new to EMF.</p>

<p>We also agreed that we need more success stories (in the form of blog entries, articles and shiny flyers for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/home/categories/index.php?category=modeling">modeling landing page</a>). A quick poll revealed that more than 90% of all people attending have been working on projects in which modeling was successfully applied, so there should be enough material to create success stories!</p>

<p>Kenn mentioned the Eclipse Foundation wants to start a documentation project (much like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/babel/">Babel</a>) to improve overall documentation, we might eventually join this project. In the meantime, we decided to form a working group comprised of members of the Eclipse Modeling Project that starts to create this overview documentation. The initial members of this working group will be Kenn, Bernd, Peter, Tamer, Pierre, Marcello, Thibault and Anthony (guys, please send me your email addresses). The working group will start its work on the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/emf-dev">EMF dev mailing list</a>. You are welcome to join us there.</p>

<p><strong>Consuming Modeling Technology</strong></p>

<p>I think there is no other technology that causes more emotions in an Eclipse committers life than P2. So we also had our little discussion about how to best provision Modeling technology. No big news here - we just re-iterated the pros and cons of using ZIPs vs. P2 and also had a short discussion about the Friends of Eclipse Download Wizard (which, rumor has it, will allow you to assemble a custom distro by just selecting the pieces you need). Several people mentioned that <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/amalgam/">Amalgamation</a> is intended to be a place for modeling distros.</p>

<p><strong>EMF 3.0</strong></p>

<p>We also discussed whether we should have a new major release of EMF that allows us to break API. Though not everybody agreed that we need a new major version (because the current version works smoothly for most people) we decided to set up an additional BOF to discuss this topic in more detail. I will write about the EMF 3 BOF later (yes, I am teasing)</p>

<p><strong>Miscellanea</strong></p>

<p>Someone asked if we need something like a model bus, the answer was no - we&#8217;ve got the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/?project=mwe">modeling workflow engine (MWE)</a>.</p>

<p>We also briefly discussed the recent change of leadership on the MDT OCL component (<a href="http://give-a-damus.blogspot.com/">Christian Damus</a> <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/modeling-pmc/msg01042.html">revoked</a> his committer and component lead status recently). Everybody agreed that to lead a component, a long-term committment is needed (which has been met by Christian in the most excellent way). We also agreed that we need to make avoid situations in which a whole bunch of projects / components suddenly are without a leader. This will be a task for the PMC.
[</p>

<p>](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81029262@N00/3383867215)</p>

<p>After the official part of the BOF, there still was time to chat and shake hands with people you never met in person before. I had the pleasure to shake hands with Anthony Hunter, who works for IBM. From our discussions on mailing lists and bugs, you could guess that we have a totally different view on the marketing of software, but it turns out we&#8217;re actually not that far apart :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing">BOFs</a>) are a great way to interact with like-minded people at conferences. So, next time you go to a conference, make sure you participate in a BOF to make yourself be heard and take part in the discussion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p><a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/using-teneo-and-emf-to-store-your-data/">Last week I showed you</a> how to use Teneo, EMF and Hibernate to store your data in a database.</p>

<p>This week, we&#8217;re going to have a look at how to update the data, add more records and how to query the database for information using HQL, the Hibernate Query Language.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t done so, you might consider <a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/using-teneo-and-emf-to-store-your-data/">taking last week&#8217;s tutorial</a> in order to get your environment set up and understand the basic concepts. If you&#8217;re lazy, you can as well download the code of the tutorial to get started more quickly. It is available [drain file 16 url here].</p>

<p>As it turns out, in order to change anything in the library database, we must first fetch the to-be-changed data, so we need to have a look at querying first.</p>

<p><strong>Retrieving and updating data</strong>
Let&#8217;s assume we&#8217;d want to the update the number of pages in a book, because the new edition has an additional chapter.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So, first of all we need to open a session and begin a transaction:</p>

<p>   {</p>

<pre><code>   Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
   session.beginTransaction();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Next, let&#8217;s create an HQL query. We want to find any books that are written by an author by the name &#8220;A. K. Dewdney&#8221; that contain &#8220;Omnibus&#8221; in their title.</p>

<pre><code>   Query query = session.createQuery(
       "SELECT book from " +
       "    Book book, " +
       "    Writer writer " +
       "WHERE " +
       "    book.title like '%Turing Omnibus%' " +
       "AND " +
       "    writer.name = 'A. K. Dewdney'");
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>We can now execute the query and display the results:</p>

<pre><code>   List&lt;book&gt; books = query.list();
   Book book = books.get(0);
   System.out.println(book.getTitle());
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Updating the page count is pretty obvious:</p>

<pre><code>   book.setPages(520);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Finally, don&#8217;t forget to commit the transaction and close the session:</p>

<pre><code>   session.getTransaction().commit();
   session.close();
</code></pre>

<p>   }</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Adding data</strong>
Let&#8217;s now assume we want to add more books (and authors) to the library.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>By now, you should be pretty familiar with the pattern of opening a new session:</p>

<p>   {</p>

<pre><code>   Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
   session.beginTransaction();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>As we want to add new items to the library, we need to retrieve the library instance first of all:</p>

<pre><code>   Query query = session.createQuery("from Library");
   List&lt;library&gt; libraries = query.list();

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Most of you know that I am working as a committer for various Eclipse-related projects (such as <a href="http://www.xtext.org">Xtext</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/m2t/?project=xpand">Xpand</a> and the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/?project=mwe#mwe">Modeling Workflow Engine</a>). You might not know, however, that I also work as a consultant for <a href="http://www.itemis.com">itemis</a>. On one of my <a href="http://www.itemis.com/itemis-ag/language=en/2621/portfolio">recent consulting assignments</a> in Ottawa, Canada, I was asked &#8220;How can we use EMF to store our data in a database?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it turns out EMF can help a long way to store data in a database. Here is how.
<strong>Prepare your development environment</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get Eclipse 3.5 M5 (<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.5M5-200902021535/index.php">click here to download</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Unpack and start Eclipse</p></li>
<li><p>Bring up the &#8220;Install New Software&#8221; dialog (Help -> Install New Software)</p></li>
<li><p>Select <em>Teneo EMF Hibernate Runtime</em> and <em>Teneo EMF Hibernate SDK</em>, version 1.0.3</p></li>
<li><p>Cick <em>Finish</em></p></li>
<li><p>You most probably will be asked to restart Eclipse.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Create a target definition that includes Hibernate and HSQLDB</strong>
In order to keep things simple, we will store the data in an <a href="http://hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</a> database. We will use the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> OR Mapper to perform the mapping between your data objects and the database. As you might guess, quite a number of libraries will be involved to get the task accomplished. Instead of creating a bunch of plug-in projects containing the respective libraries, or - even worse - copying all libraries into our project, we&#8217;ll set up a target definition. Target definitions help to maintain a common set of dependencies for all developers on a team, which is a Good Thing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new project <em>library.target</em> (File -> New -> Project&#8230; -> General -> Project)</p></li>
<li><p>Create three folders in this project: <em>hibernate</em>, <em>dependencies</em>, <em>hsqldb</em></p></li>
<li><p>Go to the <a href="http://www.springsource.com/repository/app/">SpringSource Bundle Repository</a> and download the following OSGi bundles:</p></li>
</ol>


<p>file
save in folder</p>

<p>com.springsource.org.hibernate-3.2.6.ga.jar</p>

<p>library.target/hibernate</p>

<p>com.springsource.org.apache.commons.logging-1.1.1.jar</p>

<p>library.target/dependencies</p>

<p>com.springsource.org.dom4j-1.6.1.jar</p>

<p>library.target/dependencies</p>

<p>com.springsource.org.apache.commons.collections-3.2.0.jar</p>

<p>library.target/dependencies</p>

<p>com.springsource.javax.transaction-1.1.0.jar</p>

<p>library.target/dependencies</p>

<p>com.springsource.antlr-2.7.7.jar</p>

<p>library.target/dependencies</p>

<p>com.springsource.org.hsqldb-1.8.0.9.jar</p>

<p>library.target/hsqldb</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new target definition library.target in this project (File -> New -> Other&#8230; -> Plug-in Development -> Target Definition)</p></li>
<li><p>Open the target definition and add the three directories to it&#8217;s contents. As the GUI does not allow you to work with relative paths, you might consider to use a text editor to paste the following text:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;?pde version="3.5"?&gt;
&lt;target description="Teneo-related stuff, mostly Hibernate" name="Library Target Definition"&gt;
    &lt;locations&gt;
        &lt;location path="${eclipse_home}" type="Profile"/&gt;
        &lt;location path="${workspace_loc}/library.target/hibernate" type="Directory"/&gt;
        &lt;location path="${workspace_loc}/library.target/dependencies" type="Directory"/&gt;
        &lt;location path="${workspace_loc}/library.target/hsqldb" type="Directory"/&gt;
    &lt;/locations&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Open the target definition in the Target Definition Editor and click on the <em>Set as Target Platform</em> hyperlink in the upper right area. This will activate the target definition. All contained bundles are now available and can be referenced as dependencies.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Create a model for your data</strong>
The data model will be based on the <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.emf.doc/references/overview/EMF.html">well-known library tutorial</a> that ships with EMF. If you are interested in a more in-depth look, I recommend taking this tutorial. However, to shortcut things, here is the ultra-slim version of the EMF-Tutorial:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download the Rose class model and save it on your computer</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new EMF project (File -> New -> Other&#8230; -> Eclipse Modeling Framework -> EMF Project)</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* Project name: library


* Model importer: Rose class model


* Browse to the Rose class model _library.mdl_ mentioned before


* Click on Load to load the model


* Click Next, then Finish
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>In the library.genmodel editor, right-click on the Library node and select Generate Model Code</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Create the library main application</strong>
In order to demonstrate how to use the data model and how to perform CRUD operations with your data, we will create a simple Java class. In the good spirit of encapsulation and components, we will create a new plug-in project to host this class:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new Plug-in project library.main (File -> New -> Project&#8230; -> Plug-in Project)</p></li>
<li><p>Open the manifest and add the following dependencies:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* _library_ (this is the bundle which contains our data model)


* _org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate_


* _org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi_


* _com.springsource.org.hibernate_


* _com.springsource.org.apache.commons.logging_


* _com.springsource.org.dom4j_


* _com.springsource.org.apache.commons.collections_


* _com.springsource.javax.transaction_


* _com.springsource.antlr_


* _com.springsource.org.hsqldb_
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Hibernate configuration file <em>hibernate.properties</em> in <em>library.main/src</em> and paste the following lines:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>hibernate.connection.driver_class=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
# use the following line to run the embedded db:
# hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:/some/path/on/your/computer/dbname
# the following line will connect to a standalone (local) DB server:
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://127.0.0.1/library
hibernate.connection.username=sa
hibernate.connection.password=
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Implement the library main application</strong>
With all the boilerplate in place, we&#8217;re finally ready to write some code. We will create a new class and add some code to create an author and his book and store both in a library.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new class LibraryDemo, making sure it has a main method</p></li>
<li><p>In order to use Teneo to persist our data, we first need to create a datastore and register our model package with it:</p>

<p>   // create the data store
   String dataStoreName = &#8220;LibraryDataStore&#8221;;
   HbDataStore dataStore = HbHelper.INSTANCE.createRegisterDataStore(dataStoreName);</p>

<p>   // register the model package with the data store
   dataStore.setEPackages(new EPackage[] { LibraryPackage.eINSTANCE });</p>

<p>   // initialize the data store, which creates the tables
   dataStore.initialize();</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we need to get hold of a session factory and request a new session form it:</p>

<p>   SessionFactory sessionFactory = dataStore.getSessionFactory();
   {</p>

<pre><code>   Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
   session.beginTransaction();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now, let&#8217;s create a new library and save it to the session:</p>

<pre><code>   // create a library
   Library library = LibraryFactory.eINSTANCE.createLibrary();
   library.setName("Developer's bookshelf");

   // store the library
   session.save(library);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In the following part, we will create an author and his book, link them to each other and add them to the library. There is no specific Teneo aspect to this part of the code, it is just straightforward usage of the API EMF generated for your datamodel:</p>

<pre><code>   // create an author
   Writer writer = LibraryFactory.eINSTANCE.createWriter();
   writer.setName("A. K. Dewdney");

   // create a book
   Book book = LibraryFactory.eINSTANCE.createBook();
   book.setTitle("The New Turing Omnibus");
   book.setPages(480);
   book.setCategory(BookCategory.MYSTERY); // oh well, let's hope it's not mystery to most readers!
   book.setAuthor(writer);

   // add book and writer to library
   library.getBooks().add(book);
   library.getWriters().add(writer);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Finally, we need to commit our changes to the database and close the session:</p>

<pre><code>   // commit changes to the database and close the session
   session.getTransaction().commit();
   session.close();
</code></pre>

<p>   }</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Start the DB server and run the application</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open a command line and navigate to the directory that contains <em>hsqldb.jar</em></p></li>
<li><p>Start the HSQLDB server using this command line:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>java -cp com.springsource.org.hsqldb-1.8.0.9.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database.0 file:library -dbname.0 library
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Finally (!) go back to Eclipse and start <em>LibraryDemo</em>. You should get an output similar to this one:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>Mar 6, 2009 1:50:26 PM org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate.HbHelper createRegisterDataStore
INFO: Creating emf data store and registering it under name: LibraryDataStore
...
Mar 6, 2009 1:50:28 PM org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaUpdate execute
INFO: schema update complete
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>To actually see the data stored in the database, navigate to the directory containing the database and open <em>library.log</em>:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>CREATE USER SA PASSWORD "" ADMIN
/*C1*/SET SCHEMA PUBLIC
CONNECT USER SA
...
INSERT INTO "library" VALUES(1,'Library',0,'Developer''s bookshelf')
INSERT INTO "writer" VALUES(1,'Writer',0,'A. K. Dewdney',NULL,NULL,'Library','1',-2)
INSERT INTO "book" VALUES(1,'Book',0,'The New Turing Omnibus',480,'Mystery',1,NULL,NULL,'Library','1',-3)
DELETE FROM "writer" WHERE E_ID=1
INSERT INTO "writer" VALUES(1,'Writer',0,'A. K. Dewdney',1,0,'Library','1',-2)
DELETE FROM "book" WHERE E_ID=1
INSERT INTO "book" VALUES(1,'Book',0,'The New Turing Omnibus',480,'Mystery',1,1,0,'Library','1',-3)
INSERT INTO "writer_books" VALUES(1,1,0)
COMMIT
DISCONNECT
</code></pre>

<p>In the next installment, I will show you how to retrieve objects from the database and query the database using Hibernate Query Language (HQL).</p>

    <p>I use Apple Mail on my MacBook Pro, mainly because it has a better integration with Spotlight than Thunderbird. It also has a nicer UI and is easier to configure.</p>

<p>However, the keyboard shortcuts are really strange. In case you didn&#8217;t find out yourself, here are the most important ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Send message - <em>CMD+SHIFT+D</em> (what does the D stand for? <strong>D</strong>eliver?)</p></li>
<li><p>Apply rules to selected mails - <em>CMD+ALT+L</em> (L for ru<strong>L</strong>e ???)</p></li>
<li><p>Select all messages in a thread - <em>CMD+SHIFT+K</em> (K for sele<strong>K</strong>t ???)</p></li>
<li><p>Erase junk mail - <em>CMD+ALT+J</em> (now, this is obvious - J for <strong>J</strong>unk)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Apple developers, if you read this, please comment on the deeper meaning behind the shortcuts.</p>
