  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Scanning my RSS feeds today, I came across <a href="http://katastrophos.net/magnus/blog/2008/08/03/is-model-driven-development-faster/">this</a> post by Magnus Jungsbluth in which he deals with the question &#8220;Is Model Driven Development Faster?&#8221;.  As Magnus points out, the question whether you can be faster by using model driven development points in a wrong direction. Just being faster is not a major goal of model driven development. It&#8217;s the quality that counts. Model driven development helps you to concentrate on the relevant parts of your software (i.e. the business logic) instead of having to care too much about the architectural plumbing around the business logic. Yes, using a code generator saves you some time. Precious time you will be able to invest into other parts of the software you build. This will amount to a higher quality of your software.  Magnus mentions some more prejudices people have towards model driven software development. Here are a few:</p>

<h4>&#8220;Higher level of abstraction = more complicated&#8221;</h4>

<p>Now, this is plain wrong. Model driven approaches do not aim at making things more complicated. They aim at making things simpler and easier to achieve. This is what we mean by &#8220;raising the level of abstraction&#8221;. I guess it&#8217;s the word &#8220;abstract&#8221; which makes most people think things become more complicated.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">Wikipedia states that</a> &#8221;<em><strong>Abstraction</strong> is the process or result of generalization by <strong>reducing the information content</strong> of a concept or an observable phenomenon, typically in order to <strong>retain only information which is relevant</strong> for a particular purpose.</em>&#8221; This definition makes clear that abstraction helps to <em>simplify</em> things in order to concentrate on only the relevant parts.</p>

<p>Consider a subway map: it is an abstraction of a geographical map, leaving out all the superfluous information, just retaining what is needed to find your way in the underground. The subway map is a <strong>domain specific</strong> map, explicitly aimed at a special purpose. If you need to find your way by car, you&#8217;d need a different kind of map.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/subway.png"><img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/subway.png" alt="Subway map" /></a></p>

<p>Abstraction in the context of model driven software development means to leave out the superfluous details and concentrate on the relevant parts. Let me give you an example: If you are writing  a software for your HR department, you really shouldn&#8217;t need to care about writing getters and setters and how exactly to write that m:n relationship mapping in hibernate. Instead, you should concentrate on the names and types of the attributes and the fact that a certain relationship indeed is an m:n relationship.</p>

<h4>&#8220;MDSD / DSLs enable business users to write software&#8221;</h4>

<p>&#8230; do business users (i.e. the people who are going to be using your software) want to write software on their own at all? I don&#8217;t think so. Modern business live is organized by division of labour, which is a good thing because it allows us to do the things we&#8217;re good at and specialize ourselves.</p>

<p>Although I don&#8217;t think business users should programm their own software using MDSD or DSLs, I believe that using MDSD and DSLs will help to bridge the gap between developers and business users. Much is gained if a developer and a business user can look at a graphical or textual model and discuss the business requirements in  language both understand. It is the task of software architects to ensure that the models being used can be written in this very domain specific language.</p>

<p>Oh, and please resist the temptation to provide a graphical language that tries to mirror a textual DSL one-to-one. Graphical syntaxes and textual syntaxes are very different. Things that can very easily be expressed in a graphical language  might look very awkward when mapped to a textual language and vice versa. Don&#8217;t get me wrong - there&#8217;s nothing evil about using different concrete syntaxes to provide views on one common / shared model. However, graphical languages are better suited to provide an overview of a system or module, whereas textual languages are better suited to flesh out the details.</p>

<h4>&#8220;Versioning is tough, DSLs do not support versioning&#8221;</h4>

<p>While it certainly is true that traditional UML tools are not that well suited for collaborative work (much due to the fact that most tools store their models either in a proprietary format or in monster XMI files), this is not true for external textual DSLs.</p>

<p>When using a textual external DSL, your model is plain text. Thus, your models can now be very easily stored in a version control system such as Subversion or CVS. And of course they can be diffed and merged. Using textual DSLs feels very &#8220;natural&#8221; to programmers after all.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>So, to sum up: model driven development is neither some kind of obscure art which takes you years to learn and understand. Nor does it make things more complicated. It aims at aking your life easier. It does not neccesarily <em>save</em> you time, but it will help you to better <em>use</em> your time to build better software. One of the reasons your software will be better than before is that your business users will be able to discuss with you using a language you both understand.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what model driven software development is about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Open Source Software (OSS) is becoming more important and plays a vital role in the IT business today. I mean, can you imagine doing a software poject without using open source software? Looking back at the past years, I must admit that literally every project I was involved in used at least one open source component. Be it a library / framework or a tool like the IDE.</p>

<p>When I started using open source, I wondered how people could afford writing software for free. That was about 8 years ago. Today, as I am myself an open source software developer, I know much better about how developing open source software works and where the money comes from. Although open source software is inherently free, it does have a cost. The people writing the software you use in your projects have to earn some money as well.</p>

<p>So, if you wonder how to support your favourite open source project, here are some ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Give feedback. Read the newsgroups, use the mailing lists, ask questions on the forums. If you like the software, say so - it will make the committers happy. Happy committers write more code :-) If you dislike things about the software, say so as well, but be polite. If something isn&#8217;t working, you might consider filing a bug - it&#8217;s not difficult at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Advocate your favourite project. Spread the news. Talk to your colleagues about how great the project is and how much time you save by using the software. Tell your customers. Write articles (did you know you get paid for writing print articles?). Go to conferences andand give a user experience talk. Send testimonies for inclusion on the website to the development team.</p></li>
<li><p>Donate. Some projects are personal endeavours of people like you and me you spend their private time on these projects. Show your gratiude by sending some money via PayPal or choose something from the developer&#8217;s Amazon wishlist. If you&#8217;re a company, thing about sponsoring the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Help on the forums, newsgroups and mailing list by answering questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix bugs and send patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy support. Most OSS development teams will be glad to provide consulting and training for their project.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy features. If there is a feature you badly need, ask the development team to implement it and offer to pay for it. If you use open source software strategically, it is perfectlyok to pay the development team for special features. It shows your own committent and appreciation. However, the new feature needs to be available to the public.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you would like to add to this list or discuss with me, feel free to post a comment or drop me a mail.</p>

    <p>From October 15th - 17th, the second workshop on model driven software development &#8220;MDSD Today&#8221; will take place in Elmshorn near Hamburg, Germany.</p>

<p>The goal of this conference is to provide a platform for professionals (managers, architects and engineers alike) in the field of model driven software development to meet and exchange ideas.</p>

<p>The three day will be organized into the following major blocks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Management Day</p></li>
<li><p>Research Papers and Industrial Reports</p></li>
<li><p>MDSD Tutorials</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The management day will feature keynotes by Dr. Axel Uhl (Chief Development Architect with SAP) and Ed Merks (of Eclipse Modeling fame).</p>

<p>Tutorials on various MDSD-related topics (such as model-to-model transformations, model-to-text transformations, external textual DSLs) will be delivered by members of the Eclipse Modeling Project on day 2 and day 3 of the conference.</p>

<p>If you use model driven software development in your daily work, please consider giving a presentation.</p>

<p>If you do not use MDSD and would like to hear about other&#8217;s experiences, you should consider participating in the conference and take the chance to attend the MDSD tutorials. At EUR 350 for three days, that&#8217;s a real bargain.</p>

<p>The CfPs and more information on the conference can be found <a href="http://mdsd08.techjava.de/index.php?lang=en">here</a> (english) and <a href="http://mdsd08.techjava.de/index.php?lang=de">here</a> (german).</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

    <p>It is a well-known fact that for most real-life applications, you canot use full code generation - some bits have to implemented in the source, not in the model. I sometimes find it funny to hear us software developers talk about business <em>logic</em>. If the business logic really would be logical in a mathematical sense, we&#8217;d be able to do full code generation. Alas, it is not, thus we are required to write some source code.</p>

<p>Over the last years, quite a number of patterns have evolved for integrating generated and non-generated code. Some of them are protected regions, generation gap, recipe frameworks, particial classes and annotated models.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to concentrate on protected regions and the generation gap pattern, as these two have turned out to be used most often in model driven software development.</p>

<p>The question is, how do you distinguish generated code from non-generated code. Looking at average enterprise / JEE applications, one can see that the amount of generated code is much larger than the amount of manually crafted code. The developers working on your projects need to quickly be able to navigate to the places in the source code where they may insert hand crafted code.</p>

<p>Here are two things you can do.</p>

<p><strong>Use Eclipse Color Decorators</strong>
If you use the generation gap pattern (illustrated below), you should set aside a source directory for all generated code, e.g. <em>src-gen</em>. Hand-crafted code (particularly the classes derived from the generated base classes) go to the <em>src</em> directory as usual.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/generation_gap.png"><img src="http://www.peterfriese.de/wp-content/generation_gap-300x176.png" alt="The Generation Gap Pattern" /></a></p>

<p>Since all generated code is generated by your code generator, there is no need to check in generated code. You only have to version your model and the manually crafted code. To ensure developers do not accidentally check in generated code, you should add the src-gen directory to your <em>.cvsignore</em> (or <em>.svnignore</em>) file. Having the ignore file, you can now turn on Eclipse color decorators, which is the corner stone of this tip. Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the preference dialog (<em>Window > Preferences</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to <em>Team > CVS > Label Decorations</em></p></li>
<li><p>Tick the <em>Enable font and color decorations</em> checkmark</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to <em>General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts</em> by clicking on the <em>Colors and Fonts</em> hyperlink below the check box</p></li>
<li><p>In this dialog, change the color for <em>Ignored Resource (Foreground)</em> to silver or light gray</p></li>
</ol>


<p>As a result, all ignored resource will appear in light gray (or any other color you might have chosen):

<p><strong>Use MINT</strong>
If you use protected regions, you need a way to decorate the parts in your code that won&#8217;t be touched by the generator. The Eclipse Modeling Framework Technology project (EMFT) has a subcomponent which was written with this in mind - <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mint">MINT</a>.
Using MINT, you can highlight the parts of the source code which have been changed by you:

    <p>Yesterday, the Eclipse DemoCamp in Hamburg took place in the beautiful &#8221;<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherstadt">Speicherstadt</a>&#8221; in Hamburg:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3087/2587210416_4dc18af47f_m.jpg" alt="Speicherstadt" /></p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3135/2587209784_211c01889a_m.jpg" alt="Speicherstadt" /></p>

<p>We had about 50 registrations and more than 40 people actually showed up:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81029262@N00/2586214951/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3059/2586214951_30c2d13207.jpg" alt="Eclipse DemoCamp" /></a></p>

<p>After a short introduction by <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Martin_Lippert">Martin</a> and <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Peter_Friese">me</a>, <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Sven_Efftinge">Sven</a> (itemis AG) gave an introduction to <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Xtext">Xtext</a> and highlighted some o the new features in the upcoming version Xtext 2.0.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Matthias_Luebken">Matthias Lübken</a> of it-agile gave a talk on <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> (Google Web Toolkit) and <a href="http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage">OSGi</a> and showed us how easy it is to build great-looking web-applications that can be dynamically enhanced by means of OSGi runtime features like loading / unloading bundles. Matthias mentioned several times that <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Gunnar_Wagenknecht">Gunnar Wagenknecht</a> provided a patch that fixes some classloading issues in the serialization code. So Gunnar, thanks again!</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.itemis.eu">itemis</a>, <a href="http://www.it-agile.de">it-agile</a> and of course the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse Foundation</a> who all sponsored the event, we could then enjoy a break with drinks and some sandwiches.</p>

<p>After the break, <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Stefan_Reichert5">Stefan Reichert</a> of <a href="http://www.lhsystems.com">Lufthansa Systems</a> presented his Plug-in <a href="http://www.wickedshell.net/">Wickedshell</a> that enables you to execute shell scripts for your favourite command shell from inside Eclipse.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Reginald_Stadlbauer">Reginald Stadlbauer</a> of <a href="http://www.froglogic.com/">Froglogic</a> gave a demo of their GUI testing tool, <a href="http://www.froglogic.com/pg?id=Products&amp;category=squish&amp;sub=overview&amp;subsub=overview">Squish</a>. Besides being able to create test scripts for a wide variety of GUI technologies, Squish can also create GUI tests for Eclipse RCP / SWT applications. You can modify the scripts afterwards, and introduce conditions, which is great.</p>

<p>The demos were concluded by a presentation on the topic of &#8220;Generation of format adapters for SAP XI. A model driven approach.&#8221; by <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Frank_Zimmermann74">Frank Zimmermann</a> of the Nordakademie and two of his students, Henning Banneitz and <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Stefan_Tanck">Stefan Tanck</a>. It very nicely showed how to use modern technology (Xtext) to tackle legacy technology (EDI / EDIFACT).</p>

<p>They finished just in time so all soccer fans could watch the encounter Germany - Austria, which also was a success (at least for the German team).</p>

<p>A big thank-you is due to our sponsors, it-agile, itemis and the Eclipse Foundation. Martin and I would especially like to say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Arne_Roock">Arne Roock</a> for taking care of all he organizational details!</p>

<p>Also thanks a lot to everyone who attended the Camp! We would to gather feedback on how you liked the camp, so pleace voice your opinion on the <a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/hamburg-eclipse-democamp-2008-poll/">poll</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>A friendly reminder to everybody <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg#Who_Is_Attending">who signed up</a> for the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg">Eclipse DemoCamp in Hamburg</a>: the DemoCamp will start today at <strong>18:00 - one hour earlier than originally announced!</strong></p>

<p>The reason for starting at 18:00 is&#8230;. soccer! At 20:45, the German and Austrian soccer teams will meet in a critical play. Both Martin and I didn&#8217;t think of this, until <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Matthias_Luebken">Matthias Lübken</a> reminded us of the fact. Since we couldn&#8217;t rearrange dates and / or rooms, we decided to just start earlier and finish early enough to <strong>watch the game together</strong>.</p>

<p>So, if you like socer, this is the perfect chance to combine Eclipse and soccer.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of the DemoCamp before and would like to join - do not hesitate to add yourself to the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg">list of attendees</a> (you need a bugzilla account to do so), or drop me short mail so I can add you to the list.</p>

<p>So far, we&#8217;ve got 48 registrations, so this will be a nice crowd :-)</p>

<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing you tonight!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>The openArchitectureWare team is proud to announce the long awaited 4.3 release  of the well-known MDSD toolkit. Although openArchitectureWare 4.3 is mainly a bugfix release, it contains a number of enhancements.</p>

<p>Much work has been put into fixing bugs. A total of 102 bugs has been fixed since the last release (see <a href="http://tinyurl.com/47mucl">http://tinyurl.com/47mucl</a>). A big thank you is due to the active oAW community for reporting bugs and providing patches.</p>

<p>Most enhancements have been made to Xtext which now supports an even larger array of customization points. Using oAW&#8217;s Xtend language, you can now define context sensitive coloring schemes for your textual DSLs or define viewpoints to your model.</p>

<p>As a brand new component, oAW 4.3 features the Generic EMF Editor, a forms-based editor for Ecore-based models. This editor provides a neat UI, thus enabling users to edit their models more quickly and with more joy than with the well-known Reflective Ecore Editor delivered by EMF itself.</p>

<p>openArchitectureWare is immediately available for download from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/oaw/download/">http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/oaw/download/</a> and <a href="http://www.openarchitectureware.org">http://www.openarchitectureware.org</a>. Additionally, itemis is providing an Eclipse distribution including oAW 4.3, UML2, OCL and FindBugs as a one-stop download from <a href="http://oaw.itemis.de">http://oaw.itemis.de</a>.</p>

<p>Having finished this release, the openArchitectureWare team is pushing onward to start work on the next major release of openArchitectureWare, version 5.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
        
    <p>Yesterday, the first Eclipse Stammtisch in Hamburg took place. We had about 30 registrations in advance and were quite surprised that even more people showed up. The <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Bahrenfelder+Stra%C3%9Fe+(Bolero+Ottensen">location</a>&amp;sll=53.553343,9.929225&amp;sspn=0.016368,0.047035&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr) (<a href="http://www.bolerobar.de/new/locationsdetail55.html">Bolero Bar</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg-Ottensen">Hamburg Ottensen</a>) was well-suited: we had a nice room good enough for about 60 people with a looooong table set up for us. Although I planned to arrive early, I arrived late due to the catastrophic parking situation in Hamburg Ottensen (have to take this into account the next time&#8230;).<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3132/2469883821_09fef9f9a3.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></p>

<p>We had some frosty beverages (a big thank-you to <a href="http://ralph-at-eclipse.blog.de/">Ralph</a> from all attendees!), nice tex-mex food and a lot of Eclipsy (and also non-Eclipsy) conversations. Networking opportunities were great - lots of well-known people like OSGi afficionados <a href="http://martinlippert.blogspot.com/">Martin Lippert</a> and <a href="http://blog.wuetherich.com/">Gerd Wütherich</a>, &#8220;The Modeling Guys (tm)&#8221; from <a href="http://www.itemis.eu">itemis</a> <a href="http://effi-blog.blogspot.com/">(Sven</a>, <a href="http://koehnlein.blogspot.com/">Jan</a>, <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Holger_Schill2">Holger</a>, <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Moritz_Eysholdt">Moritz</a> and me) and <a href="http://www.gentleware.com">Gentleware</a> (<a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Stefan_Zeug">Stefan</a> and <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Andre_Lahs">André</a>), <a href="http://www.wickedshell.net/blog/">Stefan Reichert</a> of <a href="http://www.wickedshell.net/">WickedShell</a> fame,<a href="http://www.aysada.de/wordpress/"> Karsten Panier</a> of <a href="http://stixdb.aysada.de/">StIXDB</a>, <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Uwe_Petschke">Uwe</a> <a href="http://www.bookya.de/autor/Uwe+Petschke/">Petschke</a> of <a href="http://www.thewayout.de/">The Way Out</a> (<a href="http://www.objectfab.de/com/index.html">ObjectFab</a>) and a whole bunch of people from companies like <a href="http://www.otto.de">OTTO</a>, <a href="http://www.immonet.de/">Immonet</a>, <a href="http://www.lhsystems.com">Lufthansa Systems</a>, <a href="http://www.kn-portal.com/">Kühne &amp; Nagel</a>. Academia was also present: <a href="http://www.techjava.de/">Simon Zambrovski</a> of the <a href="http://www.tu-harburg.de/index_e.html">Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg</a> brought some of his students. Last not least, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/staff.php">Ralph Müller</a> of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/">Eclipse Foundation</a>, who tirelessly answered questions and connected people.</p>

<p>Everybody Ralph and I talked to thought that the event was a big success and asked for more. As the term &#8221;<a href="http://www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/Stammtisch">Stammtisch</a>&#8221; implies, this is a somewhat regular event, so there will most definitely be a follow-up event later this year. If there is enough interest (just leave a comment on this post), we will try to arrange an Eclipse Stammtisch each quarter, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Another excellent opportunity to network and exchange ideas concerning Eclipse is the upcoming <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg">Eclipse DemoCamp in Hamburg</a>, which I happen to organize together with <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Martin_Lippert">Martin Lippert</a> of <a href="http://www.it-agile.de/">it-agile</a>. After the Stammtisch, Martin and I went to check out a possible location for this event which looked quite promising. If you are interested in attending the Eclipse DemoCamp in Hamburg, add yourself to the list of attendees in the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg">wiki</a>. If you would like to <em>give</em> a demo, please add yourself to the list of presenters. If you cannot come to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Hamburg</a> to attend the DemoCamp, choose one of the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition">DemoCamps in a city near you</a> or organize your own DemoCamp.</p>

    <p>As I already mentioned in <a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/openarchitectureware-43-to-be-released-in-april-2008/">my last posting</a>, we&#8217;re working on openArchitectureWare 4.3. Our build server has been busy assembling a fresh nightly release which can be downloaded from <a href="http://oawbranch.pluginbuilder.org/">http://oawbranch.pluginbuilder.org/.</a></p>

<p>If you are lazy, you may also try our openArchiectureWare distribution, which contains the prerelease version of oAW 4.3 plus all dependencies. The distro is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux Gtk and Linux Gtk 64 from  <a href="http://oaw.itemis.eu/5408/downloads.html">http://oaw.itemis.eu</a>.</p>

<p>If you spot any bugs, please be sure to report them in <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">bugzilla</a>.</p>
