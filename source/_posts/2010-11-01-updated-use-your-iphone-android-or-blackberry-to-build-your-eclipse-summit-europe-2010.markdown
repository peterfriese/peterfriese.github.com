As I'm writing this, Eclipse Summit Europe 2010 is merely hours away and everyone is getting excited to get there and meet Eclipse family.

I think the program committee have done a great job at putting together an exciting conference program with lots of technical sessions, interactive tutorials and inspiring keynotes.

As a special treat for smart phone users, we're offering a conference schedule app for iPhone, Android and all other smart phones that come with a browser.

<!-- more -->

Besides reviewing the **conference schedule** and getting to know the **speakers** you can use the apps to create your very **own personal conference schedule**. Usually, conference attendees will use the printed conference program to mark their favorite talks - and then leave their personalized copy of the program in their hotel room or elsewhere in the conference halls!

This will probably not happen with the smart phone app, although I can recall somebody lost their iPhone at this year's EclipseCon...

Without further ado, here's a preview of the iPhone app in action:

You can download the **iPhone app** from the App Store. It is available world-wide and we already have a few downloads from Singapore, Korea and India! For your convenience, [here's the link to the app](http://bit.ly/ese_app_intl).

We also prepared a version for **Android** users. Here's how it will look like on your Android device:

Head over to the Android Marketplace and search for "eclipse summit", or use your barcode scanner:

The **mobile web app** <del>will be available from the Wifi landing page at the conference venue</del> is available via the following URL: [http://bit.ly/ese_app_mobile2/](http://bit.ly/ese_app_mobile2).

<del>Rumor has it even BlackBerry users will get a native app.</del> [Ekke](http://ekkescorner.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/ese-app-for-blackberry/) has created a native app for BlackBerry. 

Using these applications, you'll be able to put together **your Eclipse Summit Europe 2010** in no time. Enjoy!

The iPhone, Android and mobile web apps have been built by a dedicated team of software engineers at itemis I have the pleasure to work with. If you want to learn how we build applications like these, attend our sessions:
