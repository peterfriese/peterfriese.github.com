[Alex Blewitt](http://alblue.blogspot.com/) from EclipseZone posted [a news entry earlier the day ](http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t84427.rhtml)regarding the popularity of EclipseZone. In his post, he featured a service called [GeoGreeting](http://www.geogreeting.com). GeoGreeting is using [Google Maps](http://www.google.com/maps) to generate texts. Go and have a look yourself, it's cool.
