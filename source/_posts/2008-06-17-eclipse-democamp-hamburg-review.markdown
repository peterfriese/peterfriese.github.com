Yesterday, the Eclipse DemoCamp in Hamburg took place in the beautiful "[Speicherstadt](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherstadt)" in Hamburg:

We had about 50 registrations and more than 40 people actually showed up:

After a short introduction by [Martin](http://www.xing.com/profile/Martin_Lippert) and [me](http://www.xing.com/profile/Peter_Friese), [Sven](http://www.xing.com/profile/Sven_Efftinge) (itemis AG) gave an introduction to [Xtext](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Xtext) and highlighted some o the new features in the upcoming version Xtext 2.0.

[Matthias LÃ¼bken](http://www.xing.com/profile/Matthias_Luebken) of it-agile gave a talk on [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) (Google Web Toolkit) and [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage) and showed us how easy it is to build great-looking web-applications that can be dynamically enhanced by means of OSGi runtime features like loading / unloading bundles. Matthias mentioned several times that [Gunnar Wagenknecht](http://www.xing.com/profile/Gunnar_Wagenknecht) provided a patch that fixes some classloading issues in the serialization code. So Gunnar, thanks again!

Thanks to [itemis](http://www.itemis.eu), [it-agile](http://www.it-agile.de) and of course the [Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org) who all sponsored the event, we could then enjoy a break with drinks and some sandwiches.

After the break, [Stefan Reichert](http://www.xing.com/profile/Stefan_Reichert5) of [Lufthansa Systems](http://www.lhsystems.com) presented his Plug-in [Wickedshell](http://www.wickedshell.net/) that enables you to execute shell scripts for your favourite command shell from inside Eclipse.

[Reginald Stadlbauer](http://www.xing.com/profile/Reginald_Stadlbauer) of [Froglogic](http://www.froglogic.com/) gave a demo of their GUI testing tool, [Squish](http://www.froglogic.com/pg?id=Products&category=squish&sub=overview&subsub=overview). Besides being able to create test scripts for a wide variety of GUI technologies, Squish can also create GUI tests for Eclipse RCP / SWT applications. You can modify the scripts afterwards, and introduce conditions, which is great.

The demos were concluded by a presentation on the topic of "Generation of format adapters for SAP XI. A model driven approach." by [Frank Zimmermann](http://www.xing.com/profile/Frank_Zimmermann74) of the Nordakademie and two of his students, Henning Banneitz and [Stefan Tanck](http://www.xing.com/profile/Stefan_Tanck). It very nicely showed how to use modern technology (Xtext) to tackle legacy technology (EDI / EDIFACT).

They finished just in time so all soccer fans could watch the encounter Germany - Austria, which also was a success (at least for the German team).

A big thank-you is due to our sponsors, it-agile, itemis and the Eclipse Foundation. Martin and I would especially like to say "thank you" to [Arne Roock](http://www.xing.com/profile/Arne_Roock) for taking care of all he organizational details!

Also thanks a lot to everyone who attended the Camp! We would to gather feedback on how you liked the camp, so pleace voice your opinion on the [poll](http://www.peterfriese.de/hamburg-eclipse-democamp-2008-poll/).
