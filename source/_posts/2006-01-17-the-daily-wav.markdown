Looking for some cools sounds to spice up your Windows? Have a look at [The20Daily20.WAV](http3A//www.dailywav.com/), they've got plenty of cool sounds mainly from movies and TV shows. I found it because I was googling for a sounds featuring Marvin (the paranoid android from The [Hitchhikers](http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/) [Guide](http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/infocomjava.html) [to](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game.shtml) [the](http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/hhgg.html) [Galaxy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/)). The Daily .WAV has quite some sounds from the "[Guide](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/)" - get them [here](http://www.dailywav.com/ha.php)!
