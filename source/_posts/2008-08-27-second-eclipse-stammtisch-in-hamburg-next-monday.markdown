If you happen to be in our around Hamburg next week please be sure to drop by, say hi and have a frosty beverage (Ralph will attend the Stammtisch, so I guess at least one beer's on the house).

Here are the details:

Directions: [http://www.roxie-hamburg.com/roxieway.htm](http://www.roxie-hamburg.com/roxieway.htm)

Please be sure to RSVP using our [Doodle poll](http://www.doodle.de/5k7x7e83mbd9p24i).

We're looking forward to seeing you on Monday!
