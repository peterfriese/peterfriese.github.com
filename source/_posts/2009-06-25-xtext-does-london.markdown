Marking the end of this years [series of DemoCamps](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Galileo_2009), [Neil Bartlett](http://twitter.com/njbartlett) and [SkillsMatter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/eclipse-democamp-2009) are organizing the final DemoCamp in London on **Monday 29th, 2009**. Yes, that's _next_ monday!

Neil was kind enough to [invite someone from the "modeling/oAW folk"](http://twitter.com/njbartlett/statuses/2177688004), so [Heiko Behrens](http://www.1160pm.net/) will be giving an Xtext demo. 

If you haven't had the chance to attend Code Generation 2009 or if you're curious what all this DSL talk is all about, I urge you to [sign up](http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/eclipse-democamp-2009) for the DemoCamp now - it is free of charge.

I was fortunate enough to hear [Heiko](http://www.twitter.com/hbehrens) speak at the [DemoCamp in Hamburg](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Galileo_2009/Hamburg). Not only is Heiko a very good speaker (with a very convincing, deep voice), but also did he manage to come up with some very good examples of what a DSL is and why you should consider using them in your projects.

By the way, if you want to play around with [Xtext](http://www.twitter.com/xtext) before the DemoCamp, you can get a fresh copy from [our](http://www.itemis.com) download site at [http://xtext.itemis.com](http://xtext.itemis.com).
