I belong to the minority of people who love the [Opera Browser](http://www.opera.com). You've got to try it, it has got all sorts of[ nice features](http://www.opera.com/browser/) - e.g. you can easily create keyword-driven search shortcuts or browse the web using mouse gestures. But I digress...

Of course, I configured Opera to be the default browser on my Mac. Which is nice for surfing the web. However, I do not want the Eclipse Help system to appear in Opera - mostly because I tend to have way too many tabs open anyway. So, I'd like to open Eclipse Help in Safari. Here's what you need to do to achieve this:




	
  1. In Eclipse, open the preference dialog

	
  2. Select General -> Web Browser

	
  3. Click New... to add a new external web browser

	
  4. In the dialog box Edit External Web Browser, fill in the following details:

  5. Click Ok, then Finish



Obviously, this only works on Mac OS.
