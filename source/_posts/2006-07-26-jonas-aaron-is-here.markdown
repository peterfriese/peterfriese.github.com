![Jonas](/wp-content/downloads/family/jonas/jonas.jpg)

Today at 3:26 in the morning, Anne gave birth to Jonas Aaron Friese, our third son. Both are well (and a little bit tired).

You, LORD, brought me safely through birth,  and you protected me when I was a baby at my mother's breast.
From the day I was born, I have been in your care, and from the time of my birth, you have been my God.
(Psalm 22, 9+10)
