[Issue 01/2006](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/publications/os/2006/01/index.htm) of the german [OBJEKTspektrum](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/publications/os/index.htm) contains an article by me titled [Eclipse RCP als Plattform f√ºr Unternehmensanwendungen](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/publications/pub_article_show.htm?&AID=1758&TABLE=sd_article) (Eclipse RCP as a platform for enterprise applications). In this article, I compare RCP applications to traditional web applications with respect to their suitability for enterprise usage. 
The aspects being compared are:



	
  1. Scalability

	
  2. Firewall-enabled

	
  3. Deployment

	
  4. Security

	
  5. Serviceability

	
  6. Usability
