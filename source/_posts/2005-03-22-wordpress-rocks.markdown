During the last days, I had some time to play around with WordPress, a quite impressive blogging software. I had seen it on Ed Burnette's eclipsepowered blog some time ago, but never found the time to install it. I should have tried it earlier! It's so cool and usable that I will drop my typo3 installation and replace it with WordPress.
