... if you're not interested in meeting local (and non-local) Eclipse enthusiasts and committers, learning something about Eclipse, Git, SWT, Qt, e4 and the iPhone, watching some nice Pixar short films in a cosy cinema, and frosty beverages.
<!-- more -->
On the other hand, if you **are** interested in at least one of those things, I encourage you to sign up for the DemoCamp [here](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Helios_2010/Hamburg) or [ping me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/peterfriese) or just send me a mail so I can add you to the list.

The DemoCamp will take place in the [MAGAZIN Cinema](http://www.magazinfilmkunst.de) in Hamburg ([directions](http://www.magazinfilmkunst.de/anfahrt.html)) and yes, we will show some short films at the beginning of the camp for your entertainment.

[Martin Lippert](http://twitter.com/martinlippert) and I are happy to be able to present a great lineup of speakers and demos, so do yourself a favor and join us this Friday from 18:00 (6pm).

As always, the event if **free of charge** thanks to the generous support of [it-agile](http://www.it-agile.de/), [itemis](http://www.itemis.com) and the [Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org).

Looking forward to seeing you on Friday!
