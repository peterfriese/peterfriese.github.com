As I already mentioned in [my last posting](http://www.peterfriese.de/openarchitectureware-43-to-be-released-in-april-2008/), we're working on openArchitectureWare 4.3. Our build server has been busy assembling a fresh nightly release which can be downloaded from [http://oawbranch.pluginbuilder.org/.](http://oawbranch.pluginbuilder.org/)

If you are lazy, you may also try our openArchiectureWare distribution, which contains the prerelease version of oAW 4.3 plus all dependencies. The distro is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux Gtk and Linux Gtk 64 from  [http://oaw.itemis.eu](http://oaw.itemis.eu/5408/downloads.html).

If you spot any bugs, please be sure to report them in [bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/).
