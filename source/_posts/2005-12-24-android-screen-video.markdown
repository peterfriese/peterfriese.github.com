As it is christmas, I decided to give away a christmas present. Many people have been asking for an Eclipse plug-in for AndroMDA to make this MDA toolkit more easier to use. I have begun working on such a plug-in. It is not yet finished, but I decided to give you a short demo so you can see how it is going to look like. 

You can start the screen video by clicking [here](http://f3.tobject.de/wp-content/downloads/plugins/android/AndroidDemo.html) (you'll need Flash, and make sure you have your speaker turned on).

Merry Christmas!

Peter
