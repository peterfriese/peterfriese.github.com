After 3 official beta versions, Opera has relased version 8 of the [Opera browser](http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/). You can get it in [Windows](ftp://ftp.opera.com/pub/opera/win/800/) and [Linux](ftp://ftp.opera.com/pub/opera/linux/800/final/) flavors.

The free version display ad banners at the top of the window. To make them go away, you can [buy](http://www.opera.com/buy/) a license at 34 EUR. If you happen to have issue [8 of the german c't magazine](http://www.heise.de/ct/05/08/006/), you are eligible to buy the browser for only 8 EUR - a great deal!

Oh, and here are the new features and changes: [Opera changelog](http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/index.dml)

I have been using Opera since version 7.x and never want to use any other browser. The most useful features in my eyes are:
Tabbed browsing
Support for sessions (opens a set of sites you browse regularly)
Mouse gestures
Quick Preferences (now, you can enable / disable you proxy with just 2 (!) keystrokes)
