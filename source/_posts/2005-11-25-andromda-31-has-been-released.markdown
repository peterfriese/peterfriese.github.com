AndroMDA (pronounced "Andromeda") is an extensible generator framework that adheres to the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm. Models from UML tools will be transformed into deployable components for your favorite platform (J2EE, Spring, .NET). Unlike other MDA toolkits, AndroMDA comes with a host of ready-made cartridges that target today's development toolkits like Axis, jBPM, Struts, JSF, Spring and Hibernate. AndroMDA also contains a toolkit for building your own cartridges or customize existing ones - the meta cartridge. Using it, you can build a custom code generator using your favorite UML tool.

A list of new features can be found [here](http://www.andromda.org/changes-report.html).

For more information, go to the [AndroMDA website ](http://www.andromda.org)or [download AndroMDA from Sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73047&package_id=117392&release_id=369847). If you need support, you can get it in the [support forum](http://forum.andromda.org).
