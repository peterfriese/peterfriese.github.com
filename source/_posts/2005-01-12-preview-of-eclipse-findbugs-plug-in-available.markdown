During the last weeks, I have been putting up a GUI prototype for the next version of the Eclipse [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net) plug-in. You can get it on the downloads page. Most of the coding has been done in 10.000m altitude on numerous flights from Hamburg to Frankfurt and vice versa. I do hope that I soon get a new notebook (one with a centrino chipset) - the battery pack of my current notebook doesn't last longer than 50 minutes...
