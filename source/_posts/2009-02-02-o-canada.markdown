So I arrived in Canada on Friday night aboard Air Canada 877 from Frankfurt to Toronto. I was very pleased to see that the flight wasn't fully booked, so I had the luxury of using two seats for the price of one. They have a fancy lighting system aboard these air crafts which might be supposed to simulate the diurnal rhythm, but if that's actually true, I lived through several days and nights on that flight!

After having a nice supper and watching "[Burn After Reading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_After_Reading)", I took the chance to have a nap and actually arrived well rested at Toronto Pearson Airport.

Canada is full of snow at this time, which I like very much - we do not have so much snow up in Hamburg, where I live.

I am staying at Ed Merks' place for the next few weeks in order to talk about business opportunities for itemis here in North America.

So, if you're interested in doing model driven software development or need some advise on EMF, openArchitectureWare or textual DSLs (with Xtext), just drop me or Ed a note. You can reach me via peter at itemis dot com.
