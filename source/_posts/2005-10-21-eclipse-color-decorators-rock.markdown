Want to see which resources are ignored in your workspace? Use Eclipse color decorators! Here's how:



	
  1. Window -> Preferences

	
  2. Team -> Label Decorations

	
  3. Check the _Enable font and color decorations_ box

	
  4. Click the hyperlink _Colors and Fonts_

	
  5. Open the category _CVS_

	
  6. You can now change the color and font for outgoing changes and ignored resources



I set the ignored resources foreground color to light gray and the outgoing changes font to bold -  now I can see what is going on regarding CVS activity. Great!
