A friendly reminder to everybody [who signed up](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg#Who_Is_Attending) for the [Eclipse DemoCamp in Hamburg](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg): the DemoCamp will start today at **18:00 - one hour earlier than originally announced!**

The reason for starting at 18:00 is.... soccer! At 20:45, the German and Austrian soccer teams will meet in a critical play. Both Martin and I didn't think of this, until [Matthias LÃ¼bken](http://www.xing.com/profile/Matthias_Luebken) reminded us of the fact. Since we couldn't rearrange dates and / or rooms, we decided to just start earlier and finish early enough to **watch the game together**.

So, if you like socer, this is the perfect chance to combine Eclipse and soccer.

If you haven't heard of the DemoCamp before and would like to join - do not hesitate to add yourself to the [list of attendees](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_2008_-_Ganymede_Edition/Hamburg) (you need a bugzilla account to do so), or drop me short mail so I can add you to the list.

So far, we've got 48 registrations, so this will be a nice crowd :-)

We're looking forward to seeing you tonight!
