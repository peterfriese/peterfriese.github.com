In IT, you can tell the season by counting the number of conferences per month. No doubt fall is around the corner, taking into account how many Eclipse-related events are taking place this month.

If you happen to be interested in OSGi (most Eclipse developers should be, as OSGi is one of the corner stones of the Eclipse Platform), consider attending the OSGi tutorial with Peter Kriens (OSGi Technical Director) and Matthias Lübken (who co-authored the first (german) book on OSGi) next week in Hamburg.

After the tutorial, Peter will give a talk titled "OSGi: Why Modularity is Important".
