It appears to me that [Model Driven Architecture](http://www.omg.org/mda/specs.htm) is a german phenomenon:

Today, I was looking for some links concerning MDA and found a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture) that is rather short. But then I realized the "other languages" box at the lower left screen and had a look at the [german translation](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture) of the article, which is much more detailed.

Another interesting observation is that most MDA tools originate from Europe:



	
  * ArcStyler

	
  * OptimalJ

	
  * AndroMDA

	
  * InnoQ

	
  * openArchitectureWare

	
  * BITPlan



So what do you think? Is MDA a german / european phenomenon? If so, why?
