In the [current SE-Radio episode](http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-11/episode-118-eelco-visser-parsers), [Laurence Tratt](http://tratt.net/laurie/) interviews [Eelco Visser](http://eelcovisser.org/) on [Parsing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing).

If you're interested in [Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), you should take some time to listen to this episode. Especially the part on [scanner-less parsing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scannerless_parsing) is very interesting, as it allows to mingle code from different languages in one single file.
