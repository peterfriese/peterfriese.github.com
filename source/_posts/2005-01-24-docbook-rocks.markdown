I decided to write the documentation for my current project using [DocBook](http://www.docbook.org/). After using it for a few days, I must admit that I really love it: using [DocBook XSL](http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/), you can transform it to PDF, HTML (one single large file or many small files, one for each chapter), HTML Help or even Eclipse Help! Much to my pleasure, I found a really amazing Eclipse plug-in that helps me edit my DocBook files (in fact, you could any XML editor to edit those files). The plug-in I am talking of is called [Vex-A Visual Editor for XML](http://vex.sourceforge.net/). Although originally intended to edit XML files in general, it has been written with enough flexibility in mind. The editor uses a stylesheet to render the XML files into a visual representation (see the [Screenshots](http://vex.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html)). Now I can edit my DocBook files in WYSIWYG - great!
