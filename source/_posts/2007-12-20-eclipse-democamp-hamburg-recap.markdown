Earlier this week, the [Hamburg edition](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Hamburg_DemoCamp) of the Eclipse DemoCamp took place in a Spanish restaurant next to the [Gentleware ](http://www.gentleware.com)office. We had more than [50 registrations](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Hamburg_DemoCamp#Who_Is_Attending) and [9 talk proposals](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Hamburg_DemoCamp#Presenters). With 48 people showing up and 8 talks being delivered, I should say that the DemoCamp was a huge success.

We had a very good mix of people - a large number of Eclipse IDE users, some tool vendors and some RCP clients. Some people even came here from Frankfurt just to see one particular demo! [Simon reports](http://www.techjava.de/topics/2007/12/eclipse-democamp-hamburg-2007/) that most people had a sound background of Eclipse.

Unfortunately, I had become ill just the day before the camp and so couldn't attend, which really is a pity. However, as Marco Kuznik of [Loroma ](http://www.loroma.com)was so kind as to record all talks on digital video, I will be able to watch the demos as soon as he puts them online on [www.loroma.com](http://www.loroma.com). That's what the community can do for you. Thanks [Marco](https://www.xing.com/profile/Marco_Kuznik)!

The most impressive demo according to [Enrico ](http://www.randomice.net/2007/12/do-you-see-the-difference/)and [Simon ](http://www.techjava.de/topics/2007/12/eclipse-democamp-hamburg-2007/)seems to have been a [model-driven](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/) [LEGO mindstorms](http://mindstorms.lego.com/) robot chasing a "cat"  (an orange ballon). This demo [](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2221/2119326823_b7d121ff10.jpg?v=0)[was ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sza/2120113550/in/set-72157603486024952/)delivered [by ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sza/2119328111/in/set-72157603486024952/)[Frank Zimmermann](http://www.nordakademie.de/index.php?id=1465&showUid=99&no_cache=1&all=1).

I would like to say a big thank you to all presenters and of course the Eclipse Foundation who made this event possible.

Hope to see you soon!
