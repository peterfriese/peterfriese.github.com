I am leaving [Lufthansa Systems](http://www.lhsystems.com) to join [Gentleware](http://www.gentleware.com).

I joined [Lufthansa](http://www.lufthansa.com) in August 1996, when I started my studies in computer sciences at [Nordakademie,](http://www.nordakademie.de) Elmshorn. After finishing my studies in early 2000, I started my career as a software engineer with [Lufthansa Systems](http://www.lhsystems.com). My first team developed a tool that helped administrators to install Windows PCs unattended. Most of the code was written in Delphi and DOS Batch. After 1 year, I had the opportunity to join another team who were writing enterprise applications in Java. Although I had never written a single line of Java code before, I was given the chance to join the team (mostly because I had some experience with distributed systems and CORBA). The team was rather small when I joined (only three developers, including me, and one boss), but grew up to 15 developers in about 2 years. We had some good fun writing J2EE applications (and frameworks).

In 2004, I was looking for a tool thet helped me to quickly create a Struts-based application and came across [AndroMDA](http://www.andromda.org). This was an important step on my way into the world of model driven software development. I started using AndroMDA in my J2EE projects, and soon started contributing patches to AndroMDA. Sortly after, I was invited to join AndroMDA as a committer.

Gentleware is a well-known company in the realm of modeling tools and I first met Gentleware's CEO Marco Boger at JAX 2004 when Matthias Bohlen and I gave a talk on AndroMDA. In 2006, Gentleware were looking for a Software Architect to join their team and help them to further develop their new Eclipse based roundtrip engineering tool [Apollo](http://www.gentleware.com/apollo.html).

My main areas of work in my new job will be to help make Apollo a great UML tool that integrates with model driven approaches like MDA and MDSD. Also, I will serve as a Software Architect on J2EE projects.

If you happen to be at OOP 2007 in Munich, just drop by the Gentleware booth and say hi. I will be there not only to present [Apollo](http://www.gentleware.com/apollo.html) and [Poseidon](http://www.gentleware.com/products.html) (our modelling tools), but also to give a talk on [Open Source MDA](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/oop_2007/program.php?cat=session&ID=13).
