At the OOP conference in Munich, we demoed some model driven IDEs at the Gentleware booth. To give you an impression, we have recorded some videos of two LEGO Mindstorms robots that have been programmed in a visual development environment based on Eclipse. The IDE has been developed by two Students of the Nordakademie and their Professor, Frank Zimmermann.
