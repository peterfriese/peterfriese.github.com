I use Apple Mail on my MacBook Pro, mainly because it has a better integration with Spotlight than Thunderbird. It also has a nicer UI and is easier to configure.

However, the keyboard shortcuts are really strange. In case you didn't find out yourself, here are the most important ones:



	
  * Send message - _CMD+SHIFT+D_ (what does the D stand for? **D**eliver?)

	
  * Apply rules to selected mails - _CMD+ALT+L_ (L for ru**L**e ???)

	
  * Select all messages in a thread - _CMD+SHIFT+K_ (K for sele**K**t ???)

	
  * Erase junk mail - _CMD+ALT+J_ (now, this is obvious - J for **J**unk)


Apple developers, if you read this, please comment on the deeper meaning behind the shortcuts.
