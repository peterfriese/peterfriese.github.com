It's that time of year again - demo time!

Being run for the third time, [demo camps](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008) can be considered an integral part of the Eclipse calender of events. Attending a DemoCamp is great. If you haven't yet been to any [Eclipse DemoCamp](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008), let me briefly summarize why I think you should consider going to one:




	
  * see cool technology in action (well, that's the whole point of a **Demo**Camp, isn't it)

	
  * get to know Eclipse-minded people from your area

	
  * have some frosty beverages and fingerfood (well, that actually depends on how the camp is organized)

	
  * see some exciting buildings from inside (again, depends on how the camp is organized)



Oh, did I mention that Eclipse DemoCamps are free? Thanks to the Eclipse Foundation and many sponsoring member companies, you get to enjoy all those nice things for absolutely free.

Here are some of my favorite demos:

	
  * Jingwen Owen Ou on [WikiText for Mylyn](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/SOC/A_Wiki_Integrated_Task_Editor)

	
  * Jochen Krause on [Eclipse 4.0](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Karlsruhe#Presenters)

	
  * Harald Wellmann on [Geodata Processing for Car Navigation Systems](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Hamburg/Session_Abstracts#Europe_on_a_Disk_-_Geodata_Processing_for_Car_Navigation_Systems)

	
  * Florian Fieber and Max Bureck on [From Model to Code - A Comparison of M2M and M2T Technologies in Eclipse Modeling](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Leipzig#Presenters)

	
  * Dave Savage on [Newton - a distributed OSGi application runtime](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/London#Presenters)

	
  * Jens von Pilgrim on [GEF goes 3D: GEF3D](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Berlin#Presenters)

	
  * Eike Steppe on [CDO Model Repository](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Berlin#Presenters)

	
  * Boris Bokowski and Eric Moffatt on [the e4 Programming Model and e4 Modeled UI](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Ottawa#Presenters), respectively

	
  * Martin Taal on [EMF/Teneo](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Nieuwegein#Presenters)



By the way, if we were to award the price of the most indefatigable DemoCamp presenter, it'd go to Wassim Melhem. You can meet him at no less than three locations: Iasi (Romania), Warszawa (Poland), Poznan (Poland).

Hope I could convince you to attend one of the many DemoCamps. I'll be at the DemoCamps in [Hamburg](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Hamburg) and [Leipzig](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2008/Leipzig), so see you there!
