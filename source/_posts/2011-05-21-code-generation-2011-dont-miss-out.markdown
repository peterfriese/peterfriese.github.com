Code Generation 2011 is [just around the corner](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/index.php) and if you haven't booked yet, [you should hurry up](http://evbk.software-acumen.com/makebooking.php?event=CG2011) - a few places are still available!

Quite a number of my colleagues at itemis have been busy preparing for this conference in the past few weeks. Besides working hard to hit the [Eclipse Release Train milestone for Indigo on June 22nd](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Indigo/Simultaneous_Release_Plan), the Xtext team brushed up their hands-on sessions "[Xtext Take I: Creating Code Generators with Xtend2](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=17)" and "[Xtext Take II: Crafting Domain Specific Languages with Xtext and Xbase](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=16)". If you've been using Xtext, you're well aware of the power you have at your disposal with this tool. Xbase and Xtend2, however, take this experience to a whole new level. So make sure to mark your calendar for these two sessions!
<!-- more -->
But not only the Xtext team will share their expertise at CG2011 - Markus and Karsten will be also be in town to give hands-on tutorials and report from their experience:



	
  * [Type Systems for DSLs (Markus Völter)](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=22)

	
  * [Graphiti + Xtext: mixing graphical and textual DSLs for sprayers/designers (Karsten Thoms / Bernhard Merkle)](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=8)

	
  * [Introduction to JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS) (Markus Völter)](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=5)



The finale of the conference will be a panel discussion hosted by Markus on the topic of "[Models, DSLs, Transformations: The Next 5 years](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=20)" - this should be a very interesting and lively discussion!

[Heiko](http://lanyrd.com/people/hbehrens/) [and I](http://lanyrd.com/people/peterfriese/) will present "[Cross-Platform Mobile Development with DSLs](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/sessioninfo.php?session=28)" - a [fast-paced and fun mixture of slides, live coding (or modeling, if you will), videos and audience interaction](http://lanyrd.com/2011/cg2011/sdpgm/). Yes, that's right - the audience will be part of the show. Make sure to bring your web-enabled mobile phone and get the chance to win a price!
