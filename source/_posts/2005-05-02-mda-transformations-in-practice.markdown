Together with [Matthias Bohlen](http://www.mbohlen.de/), I'll be giving a talk on MDA transformation at the [JAX](http://www.jax.de) conference in May 2005.

Matthias and I will explain what transformations are and how to use the in modern MDA frameworks. Of course, since both of us are members of the [AndroMDA](http://www.andromda.org) [team](http://team.andromda.org), we will show the use of MDA model to code transformations in AndroMDA and explain why the AndroMDA team chose not to use model to model transformations. A german abstract of the talk can be found [here](http://www.jax.de/konferenzen/psecom,id,272,nodeid,,.html#MG3).
